This would make Signal a force to be reckoned with! And the more people who use it, the less likely politicians could move society against it without consequences. Plus, being able to have a social experience where you are less likely to have employers, future employers, snoopy people, creepy companies, etc nose through your personal life events, preferences, and opinions is like… I don’t know… a thought that gives me all kinds of fuzzy warm feelings! <img src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/images/emoji/apple/smile.png?v=9\" title=\":smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":smile:\"></p>\n<p>It would almost be like a REAL social experience, like the ones made in real life!

Take it, use it, bury it, whatever… Thanks for making a great app!</p>",

Sometimes you want to have a community to share with that isn’t the whole world. Signal is well designed for that. But, having a large group chat makes less sense in some cases than would a social network. I think there are some great use cases for timelines/events/somewhat sharable content.</p>\n<p>Case in point would be a large team or organization, where files, events, posts, etc could be shared and passed along within the group, but out of access of some random company’s hands.</p>\n<p>In other words, it’s a better middle ground than the current popular social options, where you can be social 100% but you can’t be social at, say 30%. Signal is a great way to limit audience.</p>\n<p>Mastodon is great, in many ways, but to be blunt, there’s a lower adoption rate (at least from what I’ve seen) in comparison to Signal. A lot of my friends now heavily rely on Signal. I think over time, especially with WhatsApp being controlled by FB, even more will come to use it. LINE has timeline, Telegram has channels… It would be great, in my opinion, if Signal had something social. Just my thoughts.</p>",

I do believe having such a social component being separate (as in a separate app which is based on Signal) would help users like yourself still have what you want out of Signal, and not being locked into an additional social service. I myself would hold the same position as you, except a part of my job requires time and work on social media - so people like myself are looking for an alternative to what’s currently out there. Signal has a lot of good things in it.</p>\n<p>My mention of adoption rates is purely regarding the fact that Signal is becoming quite popular, and Mastodon (and many other alternative services) are relatively unknown. I think a lot of people would dump FB if they had a well-known, trusted, secure platform which they could use to do similar things. I think that there are a lot of people who would be interested in something like this.</p>",
