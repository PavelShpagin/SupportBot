        "cooked": "<p>[Y] I have searched open and closed issues for duplicates</p>\n<h3>Issue Description</h3>\n<h4>Background</h4>\n<p>I use signal for most messaging, and most are not needing expiry dates. Specifically, having a long history is beneficial. This history includes many images. The result of this is that my Signal backup file is now 2.57GB in size, with each file having a different name.</p>\n<h4>Problem</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>It is now very slow to backup.</li>\n<li>It impacts available storage (or the number of backups that can be kept).</li>\n<li>Copying backup files to cloud storage is also slow and unreliable due to size.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Suggested Solution</h3>\n<p>Any one of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Incremental backups to new file: just backup what was changed since the last (incremental or full) backup.</li>\n<li>Time-based backups: allow the user to say “Only backup what changed since time T” (poor-man’s incremental)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What would be involved?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Allowing for multiple backups files to be created</li>\n<li>Allowing for multiple backup files to be restored</li>\n<li>If it’s not already done, then each message would need a date and an invariant (across backup/restore) unique ID</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the simplest implementation, each backup file would be a self-contained backup with a date-of-backup. Ideally (but not essential) it should be able to be restored at any time, not just at app-install time (see below).</p>\n<h3>Possible problems</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Missing backup files: the backup storage implementation should not rely on a complete set of files. Files should be independent. In the case of conflict for a given message or setting, the most recent (according to internal backup date) should be used.</li>\n<li>I’m guessing there’s a reason why backups can only be restored at install-time. Revisiting this choice might be beneficial (see below), although processing multiple files at this time would be sufficient to alleviate the problem.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Benefits</h4>\n<p>It completely addresses the issues raised initially (after the first huge backup file is sent to the cloud):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fast backup.</li>\n<li>Substantially reduced storage consumption.</li>\n<li>Improved cloud sync reliability.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Allowing multiple files may also make the following possible:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Restoring missing messages from Desktop version as well as app version (a merge)</li>\n<li>Merging data from two devices (if one has been used temporarily while another was being repaired)</li>\n</ul>",

Our boss is a Signal user on Android. He has the problem that he can't backup his Signal app data to the SD card and despite 128 GB of internal memory,  he no longer has free internal storage, mainly because of the signal backups.  The most reasonable explanation was that his Android version doesn't support file systems other than FAT32 on SD cards.  FAT32 has some limitations, such as a maximum file size of ~4 GB.  His Signal installation uses more than 4 GB.  To us, the use of a sd card for backups also seems advantageous, as it is easier to get at the data if the device breaks down.\n\nWe discussed several solutions.  The best solution we came up with, is to just chunk the Signal backup into parts smaller than 4 GB, if desired.  I was tasked to implement it.  To use this code in a real Signal installation, it has to be in the official release.  Now, here is my MR! :-)</span></p>\n  </div>\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n<aside class=\"onebox githubissue\" data-onebox-src=\"https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/11951\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/11951\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"github-row\">\n  <div class=\"github-icon-container\" title=\"Issue\">\n\t  <svg width=\"60\" height=\"60\" class=\"github-icon\" viewbox=\"0 0 14 16\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z\"></path></svg>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"github-info-container\">\n    <h4>\n      <a href=\"https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/11951\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Large backup to FAT does not warn user of unsuccessful backup</a>\n    </h4>\n\n    <div class=\"github-info\">\n      <div class=\"date\">\n        opened <span class=\"discourse-local-date\" data-format=\"ll\" data-date=\"2022-02-02\" data-time=\"15:03:18\" data-timezone=\"UTC\">03:03PM - 02 Feb 22 UTC</span>\n      </div>\n\n\n      <div class=\"user\">\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/janvlug\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">\n          <img alt=\"janvlug\" src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/uploads/db3609/original/3X/f/e/fe60707c6fd59502e466e723b9a745338f7a1d85.png\" class=\"onebox-avatar-inline\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">\n          janvlug\n        </a>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"labels\">\n        <span style=\"display:inline-block;margin-top:2px;background-color: #B8B8B8;padding: 2px;border-radius: 4px;color: #fff;margin-left: 3px;\">\n          acknowledged\n        </span>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  <div class=\"github-row\">\n    <p class=\"github-body-container\">&lt;!-- This is a bug report template.

The user does not get a warning, and thinks that they have a good backup, which is not the case.\n\nThe restore of the partial backup did not get messages back, changed my safety number and disconnected my linked devices.\n\nI consider this as a very severe issue, because I lost all history while I thought that I made a valid backup.\n\n### Device info\n\n**Device:** Nokia 4.2\n**Android version:** 11\n**Signal version:** 0.0.0\n\n### Link to debug log</span></p>\n  </div>\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n",

It’s a(n ageing) Huawei Mate 20 Pro, which uses an NM card (an obscure SIM card shaped microSD card which are somewhat unobtanium to find in stores), which will be fun to replace… I’m wondering whether this is my sign that my NM card is getting towards the comfortable end of its serviceable lifetime writes <img src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/images/emoji/apple/sweat_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":sweat_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":sweat_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>It was really encouraging to hop onto the forum here for the first time and notice <a href=\"https://community.signalusers.org/t/tune-backup-frequency-to-reduce-flash-wear/14040/15\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Tune backup frequency to reduce flash wear - #15 by Signal.DE</a> right at the top of the list with some recent activity <img src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/images/emoji/apple/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>I wanted to open an adjacent feature request to provide an option to allow for local incremental backup. A moderator let me know my submission was a duplicate, so I’m adding it here as a comment to +1 my support of the idea.</p>\n<p>I believe this approach concedes a reasonable amount of UX simplicity for vastly superior technical efficiency, and is the trade-off I would select in a heartbeat myself.</p>\n<p>It would be 100% reasonable to put the option behind a modal with like a 10 second delay on the OK button, with a big fat warning explaining that all of the incremental backup files would need to be preserved in order for a restore to complete successfully. Make the UI appropriately frightening. Scare away 90% of users. The current strategy of having one single backup file does make a lot of sense for a lot of reasons.</p>\n<p>Of course, scaring off virtually all users would mean the option would have incredibly low long-term uptake, and theoretically at constant risk of being removed.</p>\n<p>However, I learned from the linked thread above (also confirmed in discussion further up this thread) that Signal apparently has an incremental backup implementation being developed as part of a paid/tiered online storage option that’s in the works right now.</p>\n<p>So, my request is simply that the project strategy around the incremental backup implementation be extended so that the feature gains the capability to save data to the file system as well.</p>\n<p>Thanks very much in advance!</p>",

        "cooked": "<p><strong>Predictable Encryption Keys</strong></p>\n<p>I’ve noticed every Signal backup is packed with a different encryption key, meaning tools such as delta compression and rsync can’t benefit from most of the backed up content overlapping.</p>\n<p>If the data to be backed up were ordered chronologically and split into fixed-size chunks, and each chunk’s encryption key were a function of the backup PIN and the [hash of the] chunk’s contents, then successive backups would produce mostly-identical chunks, saving a great deal of data transfer and storage. There would be no difference between a regular backup and an incremental backup (see: “single file mode”.)</p>\n<p>If it’s difficult to split the messages database, I imagine most of the benefit would be realized if this strategy applied only to media &amp; attachments.</p>\n<p>A largely-incremental backup becomes almost free at this point: when storing multiple backups, chunks common to several backups don’t need to be stored or transferred again.</p>\n<p><strong>Storage and Transfer</strong></p>\n<p>There’s subtlety in deciding how to represent the subset of all chunks which are used by a given backup.</p>\n<p><strong>Folder-per-backup:</strong> If the chunks comprising a single backup were placed into one folder, we’d have to do something special to ensure each common chunk is stored and transferred once. On COW filesystems, this is easy, but I suspect those aren’t common on Android. Hard links are far more likely to be noticed by tools like rsync and cloud storage clients; the APIs for determining if two files share extents/blocks tend to be system-specific, if not filesystem-specific.</p>\n<p><strong>Single Folder &amp; Manifests</strong>: putting all chunks in a common folder avoids using features that might not exist on all filesystems, and guarantees common chunks are stored/transferred once. I would suggest that each backup should produce a plain text manifest listing the specific chunks referenced by that backup; I’d be inclined to say this manifest should be both human and machine readable, and write-only from Signal’s point of view.</p>\n<p><strong>Regardless</strong> of how this is done, we ought to verify that most off-device transfer options, e.g., Google Drive, rsync, etc. realize that chunks of the most recent backup which have already been backed up don’t need to be transferred again.</p>\n<p><strong>Single File Mode</strong></p>\n<p>If it’s desirable to retain the ability to produce a backup which is a single, self-contained file, I recommend that file be a simple TAR or ZIP of the chunks. Tools like rsync and maybe cloud storage clients might still be able to leverage repeated content, and users could easily convert a single-file backup to the chunked format (or vice versa).</p>",
