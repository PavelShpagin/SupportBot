        "cooked": "<p>I recently upgraded my phone (iOS) and was trying to move my messages over. To my surprised I found that I couldn’t, but found some related open issues on the matter in the Github project (<a href=\"https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-iOS/issues/905\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">#905</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-iOS/issues/2542#issuecomment-350965184\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">#2542</a> (where I asked about the status)). To my surprise when I returned I found <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#2542</span> was locked by <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/michaelkirk\">@michaelkirk</a> but he did not give an update to any of the questions asks about how to backup or export messages.</p>\n<p>He did, however point people to the forums here. So, as an iOS user who regretfully used Signal, what are my options here? I have my email threads from the early 90s, and my ICQ and AIM logs from the late 90s and 2000s, but it looks like I have no access to the past year of Signal messages on my device?</p>\n<p>What kind of stupid security hack do I need to be able to extract my history logs from this terrible app? Will an iOS 11 jailbreak do or are the apps databases further encrypted? If I ever reset my phone does that mean all my messages are lost forever? (even w/ a full device backup?)</p>",

Forums are for discussion. We need to understand Open Whisper System has extremely small development team, so any drift out of focus, like discussion on bug tracker, we are eating there valuable time they are focusing on development, new features or fixing bugs. They have internal list of feature they would like to implement, one of them is full backup. I fully understand that full backup is very important to you, but for example it is completely unimportant to me - I use Signal for transport of info, anything important I save outside of Signal. I am not saying this feature is not important to a lot of people. But in my humble opinion we need to be little bit patient and let them prioritize the features.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"randomfoo\" data-post=\"1\" data-topic=\"1736\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/user_avatar/community.signalusers.org/randomfoo/48/655_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> randomfoo:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>an iOS user who regretfully used Signal</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>and</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"randomfoo\" data-post=\"1\" data-topic=\"1736\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/user_avatar/community.signalusers.org/randomfoo/48/655_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> randomfoo:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What kind of stupid security hack do I need to be able to extract my history logs from this terrible app?</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>I understand your frustration, but negative energy will not solve anything. Being nice, polite and humble is the way to go in order to expect anyone to sacrifice valuable free time to help you in the first place. But in my humble opinion, if you would really hate Signal you would stop using it, but you know how good it is and would like to make it better. You are frustrated, but you care.</p>\n<p>And to the main problem, backup, there is currently no official way to do a backup of Signal data. Open Whisper System have a list of feature they will implement. This feature is one of the top feature they will implement, I am sure of that, too many users asking for this, but we just need to be patient. There was plenty of discussion on this topic already on forum, see backup search result: <a href=\"https://whispersystems.discoursehosting.net/search?q=backup\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Search results for 'backup' - Signal Community</a></p>",
