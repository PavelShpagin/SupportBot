We enjoy having the ability to do live video calls/meeting during the game, to chat and read poker faces, as you do. My poker playing buddies unfortunately were not impressed with the UI/UX of the PIP or “mini-window” when it came to playing the poker game so we had to revert back to Viber which has this functionality <img src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/images/emoji/apple/frowning.png?v=12\" title=\":frowning:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":frowning:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p><strong>Feature Requests / Issues with PiP:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>The PiP or \"mini-window does not pin to the top over the PokerStars program (or any other opened/actively used program) which caused a huff and puff about minimizing and scaling of the PokerStars gaming application windows to allow for the video feed of the Signal PIP to be seen and poker game to be played.</li>\n<li>The PiP of “mini-window” appears to be very small when in mini mode, can this be increased or can the ability to drag a corner to make the mini window larger making it <strong>scalable</strong> .</li>\n<li>On the mini-window, is it possible to have the <strong>Turn off Camera</strong> and <strong>Mute mic</strong> buttons accessible in order to pop out of the room and deal with life’s little issues off camera while the poker game continues as normal for example.</li>\n<li>Again in the “mini-window”, I understand the active speaker gets the spotlight but is it possible to have the ability to pin or select another live player/user via the mini window without the need to go back into main desktop application. It would be cool during silent times to have players live video feeds (not the ones with Camera’s off) rotate and take focus for a couple of seconds then change to next.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>See image of desired list of feature requests.

        "cooked": "<p>Hi, newbie in the house. Backstory - I manged to get a poker group of friends to move from Viber to a Signal video meeting. For the most part the messaging application via Desktop (Linux, Windows, Mac), iOS and Android works as expected though we do miss the <strong>Polls</strong> and <strong>ability to edit messages</strong> after posting as in Viber but such is life, we must wait. It would be cool to be able to have a certain amount of time to edit posted messages in order to correct spellings and grammar.</p>\n<p>Anyway we meet one night of the week to play a poker game and we enjoy having the ability to do live video calls/meeting during the game, to chat and read poker faces. My friends unfortunately were not impressed with the UI/UX when it came to playing the poker game so we had to revert back to Viber <img src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/images/emoji/apple/frowning.png?v=9\" title=\":frowning:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":frowning:\"></p>\n<p><strong>The reasons given were the following:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Signals Desktops drag-able <strong>mini-window</strong> does not seem to pin to the top over all applications. I would have thought that was expected behavior as it usually would be highly required. My poker playing friends are lost with out it this hence the move back to Viber for video calls.</li>\n<li>The mini window is very small when in mini mode, can this be increased or can the ability to drag a corner to make the mini window larger making it <strong>scalable</strong>.</li>\n<li>Again in the mini window, I understand the active speaker gets the spotlight but is it possible to have the ability to pin or select another live player/user via the mini window without the need to go back into main desktop application. It would be cool during silent times to have players live video feeds (not the ones with Camera’s off) rotate and take focus for a couple of seconds then change to next.</li>\n<li>On the mini-window, is it possible to have the <strong>Turn off Camera</strong> and <strong>Mute mic</strong> buttons accessible in order to pop out of the room and deal with life’s little issues off camera while the poker game continues as normal.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I think the Mini Window area is a powerful area to control and needs a bit of love and attention making it one of the stand out features when it comes to group video chats. I hope my points were made accurately. <strong>If people think these are bugs, I will post to Github if required</strong>.</p>\n<p>Thank you in advance</p>\n<p>Thanks for all you do and the opportunity to use your platform and applications. I have attached a picture of what is going on regarding our particular situation.</p>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://community.signalusers.org/uploads/db3609/original/3X/c/8/c8c9a0ac9f092290c7e6fd1b2cec282f54862ba1.png\" data-download-href=\"https://community.signalusers.org/uploads/db3609/c8c9a0ac9f092290c7e6fd1b2cec282f54862ba1\" title=\"windowing_ui_ux_feature_request\"><img src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/uploads/db3609/optimized/3X/c/8/c8c9a0ac9f092290c7e6fd1b2cec282f54862ba1_2_625x500.png\" alt=\"windowing_ui_ux_feature_request\" data-base62-sha1=\"sEftIrpdWeJ7EAPaGgLS6wXOStz\" width=\"625\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://community.signalusers.org/uploads/db3609/optimized/3X/c/8/c8c9a0ac9f092290c7e6fd1b2cec282f54862ba1_2_625x500.png, https://community.signalusers.org/uploads/db3609/optimized/3X/c/8/c8c9a0ac9f092290c7e6fd1b2cec282f54862ba1_2_937x750.png 1.5x, https://community.signalusers.org/uploads/db3609/optimized/3X/c/8/c8c9a0ac9f092290c7e6fd1b2cec282f54862ba1_2_1250x1000.png 2x\" data-small-upload=\"https://community.signalusers.org/uploads/db3609/optimized/3X/c/8/c8c9a0ac9f092290c7e6fd1b2cec282f54862ba1_2_10x10.png\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">windowing_ui_ux_feature_request</span><span class=\"informations\">1280×1024 303 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use xlink:href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>",
