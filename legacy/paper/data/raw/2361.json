        "cooked": "<p>In short:<br>\nSuggestion to allow for multiple seperate (user) profiles within Signal Priavate Messenger. Either one for each SIM for dual Sim phones, or any number of user defined profiles to which a conversation can assigned.</p>\n<p>This is a suggestion for a feature which other messenging apps seem to not have put any effort in yet. Therefore, implementing this might also give signal an edge and some publicity.<br>\nBut besides that its just something some of us expected would be standard in 2018. Need to have.</p>\n<p>I for one have a dual sim phone. In my case one sim for private use, anothe for business. The business sim I may take out of my phone once or twice a year to hand over to a buisness partner.</p>\n<p>The issue:<br>\nIn messaging apps including signal, all conversations are part of one account. They are all mixed together. On top of that (issue 2) my buisness partners can see the same profile as my family. This is rather restricting. My mother can see what my girlfriend can see and what my clients can also see. Just take a minute to imagine that. Yea that sucks right?</p>\n<p>Suggestion:<br>\nMultiple (user) profiles in signal.<br>\nIts a rather drastic step, I know. But think about it. Its human nature to uphold <strong>different identities</strong>. And this is also what privacy is about. I for one would love to <strong>keep those identities seperate</strong>.<br>\nThe solution could be to have one identify for each sim card, or the solution could be to allow users to make infinite profiles and group contacts in them.</p>\n<p>I know this would be a massive undertaking, all I ask is that we think about this. Could this be something we want?</p>\n<p>Addition:<br>\nBoth solutions are also relevant to single SIM phones!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In case of coupling a profile to a certain SIM instead of a certain phone, a user can switch his SIM for another one and also assume a different identity to use with it.</li>\n<li>In case of user defined profiles coupled to certain conversations, it obviously doesnt matter how many SIMs are in the phone, it will also be of use to single SIM phones.</li>\n</ul>",

Somehow.</p>\n<p>And with each signal user account, allow the user to set adiferent name, different profile picture, different security number, different description. To a point where someone with my work number could also chat with my private number and have no idea they are the same person from the same phone. This way I can comfortably have a public number and a private number on the same phone, without wondering if anyone with my work number can see my silly profile picture on my private account.</p>\n<p>This is tough, it seems Android isn’t completely ready for this level of seperation, because on my android 7.0 I cant find a way to effectivly couple one sim card to one abdroid account and the other to another android account. There is an option for it, but I am not sure this really seperates in app identities.</p>\n<p>The only thing I am willing to leave an option to link to both accounts is notification. For instance get a notification on your android work account that signal has received a message on your android private account.</p>\n<p>Why is this so difficult with phones these days, it’s 2018.
