        "cooked": "<p>A common complaint of new users - especially former Telegram users - is that their previous chat history is not available on newly linked (desktop) devices. This should be resolved by transferring the chat history from the phone or other existing devices to the new device via the Internet. Could be implemented more or less by forwarding the messages via the Signal protocol with an additional “history tag” or so.</p>\n<p>This process should preferrably:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>by default only occur when all devices are in a WLAN, to save mobile internet traffic (configurable)</li>\n<li>have the ability to be invoked at a later time, because it is likely a lengthy process, but users want to use the desktop app immediately</li>\n<li>be able to be interrupted and continued - lengthy process, WLAN connection might be lost, etc</li>\n<li>the case of unlinked and relinked devices must be handled. A naive full transfer would lead to duplicate messages.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I don’t know if currently each message has a unique id, but if that is the case, one could compare lists of ids and only transfer the missing messages.</p>\n<p>It would also be useful to allow a transfer from the desktop to the phone. This way, the desktop would serve as a kind of automatic backup. If the phone is lost, the existing messages would be transferred from the desktop install to the new phone.</p>",

As this situation occurs only a few times there isn’t a problem with constructing a secure, but lavish process. Basicly the only concern I got from skimming this thread is when getting your device in hands it does not belong. If there would be any security concerns with syncing in general that feature shouldn’t exist either. So, when having an algorithm that needs two confirmations within, say a day, an attack which involves a scenario like Kathy mentioned, would be much more difficult. For example you can opt-in synchronization in general, which needs a day, an then if activated, sync between devices with a short confirmation. Anyway I like having my conversations syncronized between my devices, so I would be pleased having such a feature.</p>",
