        "cooked": "<p>A. I recently learned that delivery indicators are in some cases send by Signals servers. For example when sealed sender is not working or is sabotaged, or on the first message where sealed sender is not being used. In these cases delivery indicators can be manipulated by Signals servers, which makes them vulnerable to state actors.</p>\n<p>B. Furthermore I learned that in the case sealed sender is working, delivery indicators are send by the client of the receiver (which is great), however this also means that if the receiver blocks you, you won’t be receiving any delivery indicators anymore.</p>\n<p>C. Delivery indicators reveal the moment you have internet access, and that could reveal something about your everyday life.</p>\n<p>I think it would good to consider removing delivery indicators altogether for the following reasons:</p>\n<p>Reason 1, state actors could send fake delivery indicators:<br>\nSay the Signal server was taken over by an evil organization. They could still not read messages, but could they send fake delivery indicators, while actually not delivering the messages at all. This could done by a state actor to cause the illusion that someone was still in control over his phone after he had already been taken into interrogation or custody. Signal strives for users to know what information is with whom. One way to compromise that security is by giving user the illusion that their contact is aware of recent information, while in fact he never actually received it.</p>\n<p>Reason 2, delivery indicators could hint you that you got blocked<br>\nIt’s a great thing that Signal doesn’t show others if you have blocked them or not. Unfortunately if you are using sealed sender, as soon as you block someone you stop sending back delivery indicators, which can give a hint to others that you have blocked them. Furthermore as soon as you unblock them, delivery indicators are being send back again for every new message. Delivery indicators are leaking information about whether you blocked someone or not.</p>\n<p>Reason 3, delivery indicators reveal the moment you have internet access<br>\nMany people don’t have and internet connection on their mobile device 24/7, and thus knowing when they do have internet reveals when they get home, or at their work, or some other place where their device connects to a wifi network. Signal reveals when that moment is taking place because at that very moment it sends out delivery indicators. this is a minor, yet a real, leak of privacy sensitive metadata.</p>\n<p>Note that delivery indicators are not an essential part of a messenger app. We can message without them, and we still have the optional read receipts in case we want to let others know whether we received and have seen their messages. On a technical level the client of the sender needs to know if a message was successfully handed off to the server but it does not need to know if the message was successfully delivered to the client of the receiver.</p>\n<p>This feature request was inspired by two discussions: <a href=\"https://community.signalusers.org/t/are-signal-delivery-indicators-and-read-receipts-also-end-to-end-encrypted/8366/23\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Are Signal delivery indicators and read receipts also end-to-end encrypted? - #23 by Meteor0id</a> , <a href=\"https://community.signalusers.org/t/not-great-for-privacy-blocked-contacts-can-still-see-the-exact-times-at-which-you-are-connected-to-the-internet-eg-when-you-get-home-or-arrive-at-work/5345/43\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Not great for Privacy: blocked contacts can still see the exact times at which you are connected to the internet (eg. when you get home or arrive at work) - #43 by newuser</a> and <a href=\"https://community.signalusers.org/t/delivery-receipts-call-ringing-privacy/5248\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Delivery Receipts / Call Ringing Privacy</a></p>",

It’s much easier to block someone if you can rely that Signal will never give the other person evidence that they got blocked by you. You may not have experienced a case where this matters, but to some people it matters a lot if their contacts can see the difference between being blocked and not being blocked. Signal has been designed with this in mind as evident from the support article on blocking, and it would make sense to try and uphold that design decision.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group quote-post-not-found\" data-username=\"Dave_Niezby\" data-post=\"2\" data-topic=\"30410\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/user_avatar/community.signalusers.org/dave_niezby/48/18641_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> Dave_Niezby:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>if you’re on Mobile, when do you NOT have internet access</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>Whenever I am not in wifi range. Many people do not pay for mobile data, or turn it off when they are not using it. Wifi often auto-connects.

But That doesn’t mean they are a non-issue. There are use cases where delivery indicators unnecessarily leak metadata to conversation partners. Delivery information doesn’t need to be available to anyone, and so it would be best not to make it available.</p>",

Quite drastic, a bit inconvenient, but appropriate and necessary.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>Agreed, to a degree. However, prevention is better than cure and many people don’t realise they’re being stalked or to the extent. For this reason, I’m very pro-privacy to the fullest extent. The <a href=\"https://community.signalusers.org/t/optional-online-last-seen-indicator/4375\">‘Online’ status thread</a> that you created back in 2018 provoked a very reasoned debate and I wholeheartedly think <em>that</em> ‘feature’ would be overwhelmingly misused as it is on WhatsApp.</p>\n<p>This issue of delivery receipts follows on with similar scenarios. But maybe less so, or depends on how the user controls their Signal app. If they only have their phone on between 1300-1400, then this <em>does</em> reveal information about them. If they keep their phone on 24/7, then it doesn’t reveal much if anything.</p>\n<p>On this basis, it’s not a bad feature request suggestion. I just wonder how much it would be used.</p>",
