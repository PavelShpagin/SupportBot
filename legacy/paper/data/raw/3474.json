The pattern is always the same, we have a specific group for a specific team and every week, one of the players creates a poll asking who’s “present”, “absent”, “available if need be”.</p>\n<p>Over the years, I have managed to get people to ditch Messenger, Facebook, whatever instant messaging app because Signal reached features parity with them (the features that these specific users used [i.e. mostly sending pictures, videos and files]). In the sports team context described above, most players have a Facebook account mainly for the purpose of answering these polls.</p>\n<p>Is there any chance that this feature could be considered and, one day, see the light in Signal?</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nGN</p>",

This tends to be more valuable than 1-on-1 chats, though, so I suspect it is all the same feature-request.</p>\n<p>One thing that groupchats might want to hold a poll about, which is more of an internal thing than where the group should have lunch, or what the group should spend their petty cash fund upon next summer, or similar kinds of topics, is related to the another feature-request:  groupchat admins.  At some point it will be possible to create a groupchat which has a groupchat-admin, or ideally, which has multiple groupchat-members that are giving groupchat-admin permissions and powers.</p>\n<p>But who decides, which groupchat members ought to have admin-powers?  Well, the obvious thing to do is hold a poll, or a survey, or an election:  “choose your top five people from the 99-member groupchat that you would like to be admins during the first half of 2020.”   Or maybe ranked-choice-voting, rather than approval-voting.  There are actually a lot of complicated ways to hold a survey, beyond the simplest choose-only-one-option-multiple-choice kind of thing with radiobuttons by each available choice.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the same kind of polling/voting/survey system would be useful when it was necessary to have somebody removed from the groupchat involuntarily (one of the MAIN reasons to have groupchat-admins at all methinks).  But rather than have the groupchat-admins exercise their power in the form of a judge+jury+executioner kind of style, it is more useful to be able to have some internal polls.  Preferably with secret ballot type results, where the cryptography guarantees that nobody voted more than once, and that nobody spoofed any other person’s vote, but the groupchat admins cannot tell which groupchat members voted which way?  But at least, the basic ability to say “dear groupchat should Bob be kicked off the island? y/n” type of thing.</p>\n<p>I consider this to be a “medium-term” feature request, whereas the more straightforward kinds of polls (as explained well in github#6646 above) which are going to be useful to everyday folks trying to plan luncheons, figure out who is coming to the next meeting, decide on crunchy versus creamy, and other “external topics” … those should be the priority.  But there are a lot of interesting use-cases here, where a polling-and-survey-and-voting feature could be applied to improve the enjoyability and effectiveness of groupchats themselves… and how they are admin’d… not just of external events out in the physical world.  See also <a href=\"https://community.signalusers.org/t/improving-signal-group-chats/979\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Improving Signal group chats</a> for more ideas.</p>\n<p>p.s.  <em>NOT</em> really related, except tangentially, is the idea of getting a polling&amp;survey-system up and running for the signalUsers forum, where people can vote on what their favorite feature-requests are.  <a href=\"https://community.signalusers.org/t/poll-builder-prioritize-feature-requests/3791\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Poll builder: prioritize feature requests</a>  One of my favorite feature-requests, would be a polling&amp;survey system implemented right inside signalapp groupchats, of course  ;-)</p>",

He has to select at least one or more dates. All group members can now select when they have time. If there’s a date which all members can agree on, the message will get a green tick and will display the date.</p>\n<p>Further suggestions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The creator can select how many people must agree on the same date so the date becomes set</li>\n<li>The creator can optionally set a specific time(span) for every date</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I really really think that would be a great feature which could, at least, put us ahead of WhatsApp. Though I’ve never been in a large group in signal.</p>",

You can “opt out” by not voting in the poll. Polls could very easily be optional (on a conversation level) as well – for starters, polls don’t really make any sense in one-on-one conversations, so they could simply not exist there. Additionally, in group conversations, polls could be an optional feature that could be enabled/disabled for that specific conversation (of course, this would require group conversations to have a much different structure than they have currently).</p>\n<p>From my experience, polls are a very useful feature for group conversations, especially ones with large numbers of users when you are trying to make decisions on things. Adding a feature like this will allow such activities to continue conveniently and securely, without users having to rely on likely non-secure outside tools.</p>",

I also agree that messaging features should get priority for implementation and improvement, but I would argue that polls (particularly as part of decision making) <em>are</em> a messaging feature and should be included on that list. Priority can be debated, but much better to include it at a low priority than exclude it entirely.</p>",
