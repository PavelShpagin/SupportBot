Anyone you were on e in a group with gets your latest profile picture, and meanwhild you can’t even see who can see you.</p>\n<p>This feature WhatsApp is adding gives you more control than Signal’s ‘no control at all’. However what WhatsApp is adding there is still not good enough, you can only prevent people who you manually add to that list from seeing your prodile picture, but you will easily still be sharing your profile picture with hundreds of group members from all kinds of groups you are a member of, without even knowing it.</p>\n<p>What I would want for Signal is that we can set multiple profiles, (one for family members, one for your kinky friend group, one for coworkers) and choose per contact which profile that person gets to see. That way I can boast to my kinky friends about how tight the leather fits around my thighs while my family sees regular me between some trees in the park, and coworkers see my professional photo’s of me in my best suit.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Note that there is one thing Signal does better than WhatsApp: Signal doesn’g hide your profile after it has already been shown. If you block someone on Signal, they can’t twll they have been blocked, they just never see youf profile picture change. On WhatsApp your picture disappears, which is hurtful, unnatural, and receals that you blocked them. It feels like your menory of someone gets deleted from your own device. I hate it. There is no point in doing that. The oicture had beeen seen already anyway so deleting it doesn’t acomplish anything but set bad blood. I hope Signal never changes their approach to blocked contacts still seeing the picture you had at the time they got blocked.</p>",

        "cooked": "<p>By reading the strings recently added to the Signal Android project you can see that Signal introduces a new term: ‘Signal connections’.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Your connections can see your name and photo, and can see posts to “My Story” unless you hide it from them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Adding content to your story allows your Signal connections to view it for 24 hours. You can change who can view your story in Settings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>By default everything you do on Signal is visible to those Signal connections. Another string explains what Signal Connections are exactly:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Signal Connections are people you’ve chosen to trust, either by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Starting a conversation</li>\n<li>Accepting a message request</li>\n<li>Having them in your system contacts</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So basically anyone you once had any conversation with. One thing that is not made obvious here whether “accepting a message request” includes joining a group, and thus whether anyone who is in that group is also one of your Signal Connections.</p>\n<p>Either way,<br>\nI personally find this a very strange concept of ‘trust’. Just one message or polite reply to someone and they can see your profile and your stories and any updates indefinitely. This to me is a violation of my privacy and free choice.</p>\n<p>The strings do mention that you have a few settings to exclude some people, but the assumption that I want to share my stories and new profile picture with someone who I once chatted with feels like something I never consented to, and now I have to manually opt-out. In fact the strings do not yet show that users will get any control over excluding who you share you current and future profile pictures with, the only way to do that is by fully blocking someone. take for example your boss: you don’t need that guy to get your new profile picture, but you also don’t want to block him. You can exclude people from seeing your stories, however you may have to include them one by one and each time you upload a story.</p>\n<p>In my option we need to think about what Signal Connections should be. Maybe they should expire after a certain amount of no contact. Maybe I should be able to manually remove people from the list of “Signal Connections”.</p>",
