The organic farming community I am trying to access are not necessarily computer users. People don’t necessarily have computers or internet over here. I don’t have either. People don’t install whatsapp, it comes pre-installed. They send messages and watch videos. They don’t necessarily know what an app is.</p>\n<p>A farmer I contacted over phone yesterday told me to give him WhatsApp phone no. so that he can send me seed group links.<br>\nHe doesn’t know what an app is or what signal is.</p>\n<p>But I do think there would be active farmer groups on signal. It’s quite unlikely that such a group would want a private hidden profile. Only the unavailability of public list search keeps it inaccessible.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Once when I changed something in signal settings, I got a message immediately from unknown number. I can’t recall exact setting now, but it could be ‘allow messages from unknown contacts’ present under sealed sender in account settings now.</p>\n<p>When strangers can already contact us, it is only giving it a contextual filter to allow people to discover public profile of public groups. Public group Messages can be made available as internet-only option.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I don’t see any difference between groups itself, just access list needs to be there. Same way people not in contact list can discover my number when I change a setting and send me sms, surely I ought to be able to contact groups should they choose so.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I am old to signal and new to farming and my known contacts are neither signal users nor farmers, hence the situation. I am also in a new place without computer or internet access (except spotty 2g tower connection). No one around is practising organic agriculture. So I have to discover these contacts through magazines. And they seem to know only WhatsApp. But groups will be there on signal. Only I can’t find them.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Every signal user wants Signal to succeed and supports them. Just by using their app they have made a choice. But signal doesn’t seem much interested in supporting them or their needs.</p>",
