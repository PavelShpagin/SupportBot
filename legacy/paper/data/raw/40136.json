        "cooked": "<p>I’d like to propose a feature that would allow multiple people to share a Signal account and send messages from the same device, while indicating who sent the message. To explain the use case, some personal background:</p>\n<p>We’re a plural system of about 10 people, collectively called Ilex. For anyone unfamiliar with plurality, here’s <a href=\"https://aeon.co/ideas/what-we-can-learn-about-respect-and-identity-from-plurals\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">an introduction</a> and the relevant <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicity_(psychology)\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Wikipedia article</a>.</p>\n<p>At any given time, one or two of us are fronting. At the time of writing, that is me, Zora. Switches happen on average every couple of hours. Because we are different people with different personalities, it is crucial for friends/partners to know which one of us they are interacting with. We achieve this irl by sometimes stating who is currently fronting, but close friends can also infer switches from behaviour.</p>\n<p>When text messaging, it is harder for others to infer which system member they’re interacting with. This means that a system member needs to regularly state their identity. A common solution is to sign every message with their name, such as “–Zora”. This works in any chat app, but there are several problems:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is easy to forget to sign the message</li>\n<li>When every message has a signature, there is a lot of visual clutter in the chat</li>\n<li>The recipient cannot quickly parse which system member sent which message in the chat history, because there are no individual avatars. Text signatures are not visually distinct enough.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The best solution to this problem is currently <a href=\"https://pluralkit.me\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">PluralKit</a>, which only works on Discord. It enables an account (system) to have infinite system members associated with it. Each of the members can have their own screen name, avatar and bio. To indicate which members belong to which system in a Discord group chat, the system’s collective name gets automatically appended to its members’ screen names.</p>\n<p>To indicate sender identity, there are two options (simplified):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sign a message like “–Zora”. PluralKit automatically converts the message so it appears with my individual avatar and screen name.</li>\n<li>Tell PluralKit when a switch happens. PluralKit will automatically send any subsequent message from the currently fronting system member.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My request is that one Signal account could have multiple members associated with it. Messages sent from any member will have a screen name containing both member and account name such as “Zora | Ilex”, as well as their individual avatar and bio. Normal chats would be displayed with avatars (like group chats) if you are chatting with an account that has multiple members. There should be a quick way to switch between members of your account.</p>\n<p>Because plurals are a minority with little visibility in the general public, my hopes of such a feature being adopted by any major chat app are slim. Therefore I would be thankful for hacky workarounds as well!</p>",
