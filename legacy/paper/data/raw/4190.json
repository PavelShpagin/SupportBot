        "cooked": "<p>There are two distinct issues here, methinks.  First, there is the question of whether signal client-apps should ALL be developed under a single unified cross-platform-framework such as qt5 + qml, or theoretically (more on this below) under xamarin-fka-gomono.  The endgoal there would involve eventually replacing signal4android written in Java, signal4ios written in a combination of swift&amp;objectiveC, <strong>and</strong> signal4desktop written in nodeJs-on-top-of-electron-on-top-of-forked-chromium.  So this is a ton of work to get going (it involves rewriting and retesting and re-performance-tuning stuff for ALL the supported platforms:  several versions of android + ios + several versions of windows + macos + debian based linux distros).  And in the medium run, it would be necessary to simultaneously support all the ‘legacy’ codebases while the transition to the newly-created XPF-codebases was happening. There are a lot of risks here, in other words, that the rewrite-all-the-things approach would not merely fail to save time in the long-run, but that there might BE no long-run.</p>\n<p>Now, the second question-slash-big-picture-issue, is whether or not it makes sense to replace the current signal4desktop (which is electron-based and thus cross-platform across windows + macos + debian-based linux distros) with either qt5 or xamarin XPFs.  This would be less work, and involve less risk:  instead of transitioning three major signalapp projects to the new XPF codebase, only one project (signal4desktop) would be transitioned.  Instead of transitioning all the mobile platforms and all the desktop platforms, only the desktop platforms would be in transition.  This is still a high-risk scenario, but no longer a very-high-risk scenario.  And indeed, signal4desktop just underwent exactly such a transition, around November-2017-through-September-2018 during the changeover from signal4desktop-the-chromeApp to the new ‘standalone’ signal4desktop-the-nodeJs-app-based-on-electron-and-forked-chromium.  So it CAN be done… but since it just WAS done you might not find much appetite for yet-another-big-rewrite of signal4desktop (let alone the much riskier rewrite-all-the-things scenario above).</p>\n<p>Xamarin is basically ruled out as ever being “politically feasible” as a client-language.  The company is owned by Microsoft, which is a direct competitor to signalapp in the form of skype and skypeForBiz-fka-Lync.  They are hostile (down from ‘very hostile’) to any kind of open source, and are still very hostile to GPLv3 and AGPLv3 license that signalapp uses for all the normal stuff.  True, openWhisperSystems is already working with Microsoft on a project to incorporate the dual-licensed version of signal-protocol into some future release of skype (plus maybe skypeForBiz), so there is an existing business relationship, but I don’t think there is any way Microsoft would re-license the xamarin-framework as GPLv3 just to allow openWhisperSystems rewrite signal4desktop.  Politically infeasible, methinks, in short.</p>\n<p>The situation with Qt5 is more interesting:  apparently the latest v5.11 of Qt Quick now includes a version of the Quick Compiler for the LGPLv3 / GPLv3 flavors of Qt5, whereas <a href=\"https://www1.qt.io/licensing-comparison\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">before it was only available in the proprietary-portion</a> of the dual-licensed Qt5 codebase.  As for the corporate political feasibility, the folks behind Qt have gradually been moving further and further into the dual-licensed-GPL-for-everybody-and-proprietary-for-paying-customers business model since 2000.  They were briefly owned by Nokia, but left prior to Microsoft acquiring the bulk of that Nokia brand, and as of May 2016 the Qt Company fka Trolltech is no longer owned by anybody and thus an independent entity for the most part.  Whether the dual-licensing by Trolltech of Qt5, and the dual-licensing by OpenWhisperSystems of signal4desktop, can be made to cooperate… that is the political question, but it seems likely to be feasible “on paper” at least.</p>\n<p>Qt5 is primarily C++ based, but since 2012 they have also offered fully-supported built-in Javascript-bindings in the QtQuick / QML portion of the framework.  So it would not be impossible to imagine going from the current nodeJs-on-electron signal4desktop to either the QtWebEngine (based on chromium much like electron), or even all the way to QtQuick+QML.  That latter transition would presumably speed things up on desktops, since the QtQuick framework ought to – again “on paper” – be speedier and more performant than electron.  So in addition to being probably-politically-feasible, and probably-technologically-feasible, there is potentially even a conceivable “business-case” to make this shift.</p>\n<p>It is still a huge amount of work though!  So there is an opportunity cost involved here:  is it more important to do Yet Another Major Framework-Transition with signal4desktop, going from signa4chromeApp to signal4electron in 2017/2018 and now to signal4qtWebEngine or signal4qtQuickQml during 2019/2020?  Or is that time better-spent on optimizing and tuning the current signal4electron codebase?  One strategic consideration is that, in the long run, it might be possible to eventually unify the entire signalapp codebase, such that signal4android and signal4ios could someday become Qt5-based apps, rather than native-platform-apps as they currently are, but I see that as a very-high-risk prediction (per above).</p>\n<p>p.s.  One particular opportunity-cost is that trying to rewrite signalapp into Qt5 (or less-feasibly-politically into Xamarin) keeps us from devoting resources to <a href=\"https://community.signalusers.org/t/roll-your-own-desktop-client-using-signal-cli-as-a-backend-bad-idea/4158\">creating signal4ncurses</a> as a command-line-interactive-version of the signalapp client, as well as someday writing a native version of <a href=\"https://community.signalusers.org/t/windows-phone-support/1731\">signal4windowsPhone devices</a> to compete with whatsapp there (often running on Nokia-branded hardware).  Xamarin theoretically supports ‘headless console applications’ as an alternative to ncurses, and probably also offers WindowsPhone support as a Microsoft subsidiary, but per the licensing issues mentioned above is not really feasible.  It <em>is</em> possible to write interactive CLI apps in Qt5 as well:  <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4180394/how-do-i-create-a-simple-qt-console-application-in-c\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">[1]</a> or <a href=\"https://www.tomhuang.com/2015/07/12/how-to-implement-a-console-type-application-in-qt5.html#a-console-type-application-with-the-event-loop\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">[2]</a> for instance.  There is no qt5-for-WinPhone as yet, though they have support for WinCE + deprecated WinMobile, so possibly it will happen someday.</p>",

On the other hand, if you have NOT opened your signal4desktop in a week or a month, and there was a lot of message-traffic and read-receipt-traffic and attachment-file-transfers during that timespan, it can take many minutes to open signal4desktop (per architectural limitations mentioned above).</p>\n<p>You can help prioritize speeding-up-signal4desktop work, by opening the various forum-threads and github-issues and ‘hearting’ or perhaps ‘plusOne-ing’ the suggested solutions that you would most appreciate seeing.  It does not help to write a COMMENT which merely says ‘me also’ however since this sends out a bunch of emails to folks watching the threads… best to let the hardworking signal4desktop devs go about the business of optimizing performance, rather than distracting them with empty-commentary-emails (hearts/plusOne does NOT email anybody so those are helpful-to-prioritization-without-being-distracting).</p>\n<p>In the meantime, best-practices is to have signal4desktop open and ready to rumble, if you are planning to use it – the speed-problems are generally related to having signal4desktop <em>closed</em> and thus getting mired in the message-backlog processing.  Personally I use signal4desktop most of the time (real keyboard and large screensize which can display conversation-list as well as more of the recent messages in the selected conversation).  If you don’t use it as often as myself, you can still keep it speedy by opening it “for no reason” once a day when you are about to head out for lunch or hit the sack, for instance.  This will keep your backlog small, and thus, load-times relatively speedy when you DO need it.</p>\n<p>If you are NOT seeing what I describe above (under ten seconds to load signal4desktop when there is no message-backlog … and well under a minute to load when there is less than 24 hours worth of messaging-backlog to churn through) then you should please open up a new forum-thread, with debuglogs and exact details of your platform and version and such.</p>",

If they share a good chunk of the codebase then it’s much easier to audit the code and fix bugs (at least as I understand it, I’m not a programmer but I get some of the concepts).  It should also make it easier to fix bugs and add features when they come up too?</p>\n<p>Would a huge rewrite be needed all at once or could it be done in steps?  As in concentrate on the desktop versions first for Linux/Mac/Win and then work on the phone apps.  I imagine it would be a long grueling process but I think in the end it would be worth it.</p>\n<p>IDK, but in my view more clients are (usually) never a bad thing, so long as the majority agree on and use the official client.  If someone comes up with a better solution I imagine people would switch to it and it’d be the new standard anyway.</p>",
