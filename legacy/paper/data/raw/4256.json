        "cooked": "<p>Ellaine, thanks much for your report.  I am involved in similar drama with my contacts, which I will not go into here  ;-)</p>\n<p>I do have some questions about what you are specifically wanting to see happen, however my first comment is that you SHOULD be able to search, and if you cannot it is a bug:</p>\n<p><span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#2</span>.  there is actually a full-text-search feature in recent versions of signal4android, and I believe also signal4ios.  This feature has not yet appeared in signal4desktop, but I believe is coming along there as well.  On the main conversation-list, tap the little magnifying-glass in the top-righthand corner, and you should be able to search conversation-history, contacts, groupchats, etc.  Is that not working for you?  Do you have permissions to access Contacts enabled on your smartphone for signalapp?</p>\n<details>\n<summary>\nquestions about #3</summary>\n<p><span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#3</span>.  Are you worried about</p>\n<ul>\n<li>speed of sending messages i.e. how many seconds it takes to deliver “hello” from france to california?</li>\n<li>or, audio quality during encrypted-voice-calls and video-calls?</li>\n<li>or, just the general UI/UX feel of how fast the app opens, how quickly it scrolls up in conversation-history, that sort of thing?</li>\n<li>maybe all of the above  :-)  but which are the dealbreakers which prevent moving over?  Everybody wants their apps to be as slick and fast as possible … “no perceptible slowness whatsoever” is the long-term goal … but in the short term, only SOME kinds of performance problems will be so annoying they cause people to uninstall signalapp and go back to partly-encrypted telegram or metadata-leaking whatsapp.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Which platforms do you need performance improvements on, specifically?  e.g. signal4desktop is slower to open the app than signal4android, but both send messages in around 2 seconds or so measured in realtime device to device.  (<em>Typing</em> the message itself is usually faster in signal4desktop thanks to the hardware keyboard however so the longer load-time is often worth it when having an extended conversation.)</p>\n<p>Also worth noting, there are multiple official clients for telegram, which have very different performance-characteristics:  classic telegram-app for ios and android platforms, which is GPLv2/v3-licensed, and the newer slicker tastier telegram-X thing for ios and android, which has a proprietary license.</p>\n<p>I have no inside info, but <strong>usually</strong> in my experience when a developer tries to get people to switch from a libre-license client to a slicker/faster/featureful new client with a proprietary license, the reason is that they are planning to monetize their userbase and want to prevent any forks from appearing once that other shoe drops.  Signalapp is gplv3 with no proprietary official clients, and although there are also a lot of unofficial signalapp clients running around, to my knowledge all of them are also GPLv3.</p>\n<p>So for performance-comparisons, you need to distinguish between proprietary telegramX which is (if my hunch is correct) likely to someday have built-in-adverts or charge money per copy or otherwise be monetized in a way you will not like, versus the performance of not-as-slick telegramClassic.  They are apples and oranges.</p>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>\nquestions about #4</summary>\n<p><span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#4</span>.  For the pinning-feature, do you mean,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#4A-welcome-to-group</span> feature where a boilerplate message that appears at the top of the groupchat-history on a per-device basis, such that every time a new groupchat member is added, they get the ‘welcome to the groupchat’ boilerplate which explains the group rules and such?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Or are you talking about something else, e.g. in forum-software on websites, sometimes a forum-admin can pin a forum-post so that it always appears whenever the forum-thread is opened.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>That is more like <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#4B-hovering-perma-message</span> feature, which in signalapp would be something like the ability to send a message which appeared at the bottom of the conversation-history of the device on which it was pinned ALL THE TIME, effectively getting pinned onto the top of the send-message-textarea and no longer listed in chronological ordering.  You might want that kind of 4B-type feature if you have multiple groupchats for a business, some of which include customers (hovering-perma-message:  “always smile at the customer”), and some of which are internal groupchats only for employees (hovering-perma-message:  “keep it clean people this is for work-purposes only”).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You could also be talking about <span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#4C</span> which is pinning conversations/groupchats so their entries always stay at the top of the conversation-list, rather than getting re-sorted as new messages arrive?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>\nquestions about #5</summary>\n<p><span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#5</span>.  I’m not sure I understand what a “channel feature” is specifically… is it a groupchat where only the group-creator can send messages, and all the replies go to the group-creator as two-way direct messages, usually called a broadcast-feature or a message-blast feature?  WhatsApp <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/29/whatsapp-broadcast-groups/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">just added that</a> a few months ago in June apparently.  Or it is more like feature#1E (see below), where a subset of people can send but other are prevented from sending by the group-admins, getting an error-message when they try?</p>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>\nquestions about #1</summary>\n<p><span class=\"hashtag-raw\">#1</span>.  can you be more specific about what is needed in terms of group management?  ability for a group-admin to…</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1A. forcibly kick out another groupmember?</li>\n<li>1B. prevent others from inviting new group-members?</li>\n<li>1C. prevent others from changing the group-nickname / group-avatar-pic?</li>\n<li>1D. prevent others from changing the disappearing-message-timer?</li>\n<li>1E. prevent others from sending, but still allow them to read?</li>\n<li>1F. prevent others from reading, but still allow them to send?</li>\n<li>1G. edit/alter the posts others made, after they have already been sent out?</li>\n<li>1H. edit/alter the posts others are about to make, prior to them being sent out?</li>\n<li>1X,1Y,1Z. other, please specify?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of these features (A/B/C) exist in whatsapp, some of them are feature-requests for signalapp, I don’t know enough about telegram groupchats which are unencrypted-server-side so I’ve never investigated them  :-)</p>\n<p>Please state whether each feature is a dealbreaker that would prevent signalapp from being used, highly desirable but not a dealbreaker, nice to have, or not really needed. For example, many people think that 1A-kick-out is a dealbreaker, and 1B-vetted-invite is highly desirable … because if push comes to shove, 1A is a more important feature than 1B, since if somebody in the group refuses to stop inviting others the group-admin can kick THAT person out of the group for disruption (1B is desired because it prevents a non-admin from re-inviting the disruptive person back in… plus is more narrow of a control that is less of a <ins>tactical-nuke</ins> type of option that kicking a person out feels like).</p>\n<p>On signalapp at present, group-management is primarily social:  be careful who you invite into the group, explain the rules of group-etiquette carefully (e.g. only certain folks are ‘allowed’ to invite new group-members and only certain folks are ‘allowed’ to post alerts… these are not software-enforced but merely socially-enforced).  In the worst case, there is the <ins>strategic-nuke-option</ins> with signalapp:  simply announce that groupchat#1 is being abandoned, and create a new groupchat#2 wherein you ONLY invite people that were not causing disruption in groupchat#1.</p>\n<p>This sort of destroy-the-groupchat-to-save-the-groupchat move is not as pleasant as the tactical-nuke feature request (ability to specify groupchat admins who can forcibly kick out bad apples from the groupchat), but it does suffice as a workaround for MANY – but not all – kinds of groupchats in signalapp.  Typically the vast majority of groupchats contain <em>only</em> participants who know and trust each other, and thus nobody would add a bad apple into the encrypted groupchat, since that defeats the purpose of encrypting communications in the first place.  If you are planning on making groupchats which contain untrusted participants, unknown participants, or outright adversarial participants, then group-management features suddenly become far more important.  Can you give us some idea of what <strong>kind</strong> of groupchats you and your contacts are envisioning, which is to say, <em>why</em> you need specific group-management features?</p>\n</details>\n<p>Do you have a link for this advert thing you mentioned?</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"ellaine20\" data-post=\"1\" data-topic=\"4256\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/e/77aa72/48.png\" class=\"avatar\"> ellaine20:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>With impending WhatsApp’s ads</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>My understanding what that WhatsApp monitored metadata, and that they are launching whatsapp-for-biz stuff which will let businesses communicate with customers via whatsapp <em>only</em> if the business pays facebook-corp every time a customer contacts the business… plus there were rumours of a plan at some point to start embedding adverts in the whatsapp ‘status messages’ that are kind of a snapchat-style-feature (signalapp does not offer any equivalent automated feature though one can always change their avatar-pic and signalapp-nickname from time to time if they wish to do so.)</p>",

        "cooked": "<p>Thank you for your replies.</p>\n<p>The full search is actually very limited. In this topic, I talk about Signal Android. In WhatsApp, for example, you can search in a particular chat, or one group, or even its members. Full text search in Signal is too indiscriminate. It searches <em>everything</em> and the results are messy. I don’t like it.</p>\n<p>As for the Ads in WhatsApp – it’s been said by many sources that their Status ads will come as soon as the start of next year. This means targeted advertising will be in place and I really don’t like it. The reason why I started using Signal recently is because of that.</p>\n<p>But the struggle is real, people around me don’t like to switch. They’re addicted to WhatsApp for its convenience and features. It’s not even better than Telegram but they don’t even consider switching to Telegram because of network effect. Trying to switch them to Signal is an even bigger task for me. Out of 200 contacts or so, I have only managed to switch 8 of them. Lack of features in Signal doesn’t help also.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, I question myself if it’s worth it trying to move everyone onto Signal. Development seems very slow and the addition of group management features which is very critical doesn’t seem to pick up any pace, at all, or even solution. I am really not sure if I bet for it for my future chat app. Granted it’s (OWS) a non profit foundation so it doesn’t have the resources like, say, WhatsApp with Facebook behind its back. But still…</p>",
