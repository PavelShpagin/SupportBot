We recently created a new announcement group to promote an upcoming action, and have been publicly sharing the “group link” URL. However, now scammers are joining and privately messaging everyone else in the group.</p>\n<p>It would be nice if we could limit it so that only admins can see group members.</p>\n<p>I can imagine this interferes with the ability for group members to see each other’s reactions to admin messages. A few options that I think would be acceptable for our group, in decreasing order of preference:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Continue showing total reaction counts, but redact the “who reacted” lists to only admins and people you’ve chatted with before (e.g., 10 thumbs up, from “Alice, Bob, and 8 other Signal users”)</li>\n<li>Continue showing total reaction counts, but redact the “who reacted” list entirely</li>\n<li>Allow admins to see total reaction counts, but non-admins can only see reactions from admins and themselves</li>\n<li>Disallow reactions in group chats that hide membership</li>\n</ul>",

E.g., who’s allowed to add/remove people, edit the group settings, and message in restricted groups?</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>Regarding everything but “message in restricted groups”, the Signal server can distinguish who is requesting or attempting to change information about the group:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Someone who just has the group link but isn’t a member;</li>\n<li>Someone who just has the group link but isn’t a member and is banned from the group;</li>\n<li>Someone who requested to join the group using a group link (that requires admin approval before joining) but isn’t a member;</li>\n<li>Someone who is invited to the group;</li>\n<li>Someone who is a member;</li>\n<li>Someone who is a member and has the admin role;</li>\n<li>etc.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Due to the design of the group system, it doesn’t know who the user is (it doesn’t know their UUID / phone number / etc.) or the content of the changed information (i.e. the new group description or name), but it <em>does</em> know what role a user must have in order to change certain information and ensures that only that role can actually make the change.</p>\n<p>So the server could limit who can see group membership. In fact, it already does this when you request to join the group (cases 1-3 above)—even though the user has the group master key (from the group link) and could decrypt the group member information <em>if it was given to them</em>, the server <em>doesn’t give it to them</em> in the first place (see <a href=\"https://community.signalusers.org/t/beta-feedback-for-the-upcoming-android-4-74-release/17539/17\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Beta feedback for the upcoming Android 4.74 release - #17 by alan-signal</a>).</p>\n<p>However, when it comes to group messages themselves (and each reaction addition/removal is also technically a “message”), only clients have the necessary information to determine whether the message is from a group admin or not, etc. So it is the sending clients who disallow sending anything but reactions and remote deletion requests (see bottom of <a href=\"https://community.signalusers.org/t/send-messages-permission-availability/36824/4\" class=\"inline-onebox\">\"Send messages\" permission availability - #4 by awaitlink</a> for source), and the receiving clients who drop any messages that the sender isn’t allowed to send (because the sender could modify the client and send them anyway).</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I’m not aware of any way that would currently allow you to send an “anonymous” message to a group without revealing who you are, which seems like what would be necessary for any option that requires showing total reaction counts without showing some or all reacting members:</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"mdempsky\" data-post=\"1\" data-topic=\"45234\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/user_avatar/community.signalusers.org/mdempsky/48/31286_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> mdempsky:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Continue showing total reaction counts, but redact the “who reacted” lists to only admins and people you’ve chatted with before (e.g., 10 thumbs up, from “Alice, Bob, and 8 other Signal users”)</li>\n<li>Continue showing total reaction counts, but redact the “who reacted” list entirely</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>Although the receiving client would still need some persistent per-group user identifier in order to prevent duplicate reactions from the same user, ensure that only the user who added the reaction can remove it, that other users can’t make fake reactions from other users. Basically, there must be 1-1 correspondence between such an identifier and the only Signal user who can use such an identifier, but the receiving client must not be able to tell from the identifier who the corresponding Signal user is.</p>\n<p>Of course, these two options could also be implemented in the current system by simply not showing the other Signal users in the UI, but anyone with a modified client would be able to see who they are, so this isn’t really a solution, as mentioned in <a href=\"https://community.signalusers.org/t/permission-to-limit-who-can-see-group-membership/45234/3\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Permission to limit who can see group membership - #3 by Herohtar</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"mdempsky\" data-post=\"1\" data-topic=\"45234\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/user_avatar/community.signalusers.org/mdempsky/48/31286_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> mdempsky:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow admins to see total reaction counts, but non-admins can only see reactions from admins and themselves</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>This should be possible in the current system. If the group is configured to hide membership:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Non-admins would only send their reactions to admins (admins will see who the reacting users are);</li>\n<li>Admins would send reactions to everyone in the group.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"mdempsky\" data-post=\"1\" data-topic=\"45234\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/user_avatar/community.signalusers.org/mdempsky/48/31286_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> mdempsky:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Disallow reactions in group chats that hide membership</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>This is also obviously possible.
