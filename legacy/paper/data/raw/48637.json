        "cooked": "<p>First of all: <em>what is this clickbait title?!</em> It’s obviously not possible to determine anyone’s location, as in GPS, using the method described in the paper!</p>\n<p><strong>tl;dr</strong><br>\nThey basically determined that if you send tens of thousands of messages over the course of several weeks and record the time message delivery confirmations take (using Wireshark) to your <em>victim</em> while you know where they currently are (home, gym, woods, etc.) - you can then analyze that data and in the future deduce if they are at home, gym or in the woods…<br>\nAdditionally, if you message multiple <em>victims</em> you would similarly be able to determine whether they are in the same city/country as you, or on the other side of the Globe. <strong>There’s nothing to be worried about</strong> and even the authors of this <em>ingenious paper</em> (sarcasm!) admit that <em>“Similarly, traffic analysis, is […] used to analyze encrypted network traffic in various other domains. Purposes include […] deanonymizing users […] in anonymity networks such as Tor with the most recent ones technically reaching accuracy of up to 100 % using deep learning techniques.”</em></p>\n<div class=\"spoiler\">\n<p>I’m currently writing more detailed explanation of what this paper is about, but that’s just a tl;dr for now. Writing such paper is just so dumb… I’m waiting for other platforms, not mentioned in it, to try and capitalize on it… <img src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/images/emoji/apple/face_with_symbols_over_mouth.png?v=12\" title=\":face_with_symbols_over_mouth:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":face_with_symbols_over_mouth:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n</div>\n<p>More details:</p>\n<p>Alright, so what do <em>they</em> say about their discovery:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We presented a novel timing side-channel in popular instant messengers, allowing to distinguish different receivers and their locations by sending them instant messages. We have demonstrated how measuring the time between sending a message and receiving the notification that the message has been delivered enables clients to spy on each other, e.g., to determine whether or not they are at their usual location.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Right, but how easy <em>in practice</em> would that be… let’s see:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In an initial training phase, the adversary sends messages to the victim and learns timing characteristics while knowing their whereabouts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ok, but how many messages exactly?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In a single experiment iteration, the phone subsequently sends <strong>a series of five messages</strong> […] <strong>The first four messages are short and only consist of a single word each, while the last message is a whole text paragraph.</strong> We send the first four messages at an interval of 10 seconds to allow for the confirmations to arrive before sending the next message, while we increase the waiting time before the last messages to 20 seconds in order to accommodate the longer time it takes to type the long text, thus facilitating the analysis of the packet captures. […] <strong>We repeat this procedure over a period of several weeks</strong> […] Whereas the physical locations of receiving devices remain unchanged throughout the Round 1 measurements, we collect data for <strong>at least one week for each location</strong> a receiving device was placed at in Round 2. <strong>In total, we use more than 240,000 messages sent during the two rounds of experiments for evaluation</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/images/emoji/apple/rofl.png?v=12\" title=\":rofl:\" class=\"emoji only-emoji\" alt=\":rofl:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>If I’m talking to someone that frequently, it’s safe to assume they either way know where I live/work/whatever… <img src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/images/emoji/apple/wink.png?v=12\" title=\":wink:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":wink:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>And the authors admit that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since the attack entails sending messages, the adversary’s behavior might be observed by the victim and appear suspicious. Therefore, the attacker might leverage timings of messages they send anyway which would, however, narrow down the practical threat scope to people who regularly exchange larger numbers of messages.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No, VPNs or Tor wouldn’t help… There’s something seriously wrong with those results - Tor performs worse than VPN, accuracy varies that much between apps, etc. But they only tested one VPN server… and then there’s Tor routes/nodes variability to consider… No, just no. Take that with a grain of salt:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We run a small additional experiment to get a preliminary estimate of the effects of using a VPN as a countermeasure. […] Connected to a US-based VPN server provided by a commercial VPN provider. Whereas without VPN, the network connection of this device can be distinguished with up to 90% accuracy, classifications perform worse when using a VPN. For Threema (51%) and WhatsApp (62%), performance is hardly better than random guessing (50 %). However, for Signal, we reach a surprisingly high overall accuracy of 77 %. When repeating the same small experiment with using Tor instead of a VPN, WiFi and cellular connections can be distinguished better (Signal: 72 %, Threema: 58 %, WhatsApp: 82 %).<br>\nWithout investigating these issues more systematically, we can only speculate about the reasons. One explanation could be that Signal’s servers are US-based and, therefore, the routing overhead introduced by using the VPN server is too small to adequately perturb timings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><br><br></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We got in contact with the providers of the messenger apps (Signal, Threema, WhatsApp) and reported the vulnerability to them prior to the submission of this paper in May 2022. Whereas <strong>Signal and WhatsApp have not acknowledged the issue to date</strong> (October 2022)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There’s nothing new to acknowledge… and even Tor is vulnerable to traffic analysis, so I guess we should go back to caves? <img src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/images/emoji/apple/rofl.png?v=12\" title=\":rofl:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":rofl:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>\n<p>(And I would argue this isn’t even traffic analysis in the traditional sense. It’s more of a <em>differential analysis</em>, that’s very limited in practical use.)</p>\n<p><br><br><br>\nIf you want to write a similar paper, here’s a protip for you: you can determine in which time-zone someone is using traffic analysis! Wow, it’s such a breakthrough in privacy research! <img src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/images/emoji/apple/crazy_face.png?v=12\" title=\":crazy_face:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":crazy_face:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"><br>\nGotta love the academia… they have such realistic attack scenarios… like <a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec22summer_wang-kai.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GhostTouch</a> <img src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/images/emoji/apple/rofl.png?v=12\" title=\":rofl:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":rofl:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>",
