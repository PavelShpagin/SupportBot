        "cooked": "<p>Apple has recently introduced a feature called Lockdown Mode for iOS that disables certain features (in Safari and iMessage for example) to dramatically decrease attack surface. Apple has finally realised that there are users that are at risk to a degree where this is highly beneficial to them. It would be great if Signal would offer opt-in toggles in the iOS and Android apps to decrease the attack surface dramatically. Things like disabling WebRTC and maybe even a text-only mode. Similar to Lockdown Mode, a disclaimer could be made that doing this is not recommended unless someone is at risk of being targeted by extremely sophisticated attacks.</p>\n<p>People that might be the target of these kinds of attacks are often using Signal to protect themselves. They should not have to worry about their chat history or potentially their entire phone being compromised through the Signal app</p>",

My understanding is, that third-party apps can participate in iOS lockdown mode, if they wish to do so.<br>\nWhat does the lockdown mode do with third-party apps?<br>\nSince I use iOS, have lockdown mode activated, I can just report my own experiences.<br>\nIn lockdown mode, fonts are limited. In websites (when using Safari), as well as with apps, for which lockdown mode has been activated, you have just a very small set of fonts available. So websites look sometimes a bit ugly, simpler, and less structured.<br>\nObviously, Apple seems to believe, that a wider range of fonts increases the attack surface.<br>\nSo using Apple lockdown mode, Signal would look “ugly”.</p>\n<p>Then, all kind of graphical elements are replaced. Take a chess app, where you have buttons under the chess board, for moving forward or backward. These buttons are, in general, graphical elements (“pictures”), which are being loaded from somewhere. All these pictures are replaced, either by very simple symbols, or letters - both included in the standard fonts, being used in lockdown mode.<br>\nApple seems to believe, that all kind of pictures, which are there for the optical improvement of the GUI, increase the attack surface, since these graphical elements could be manipulated.<br>\nThis is sometimes hard to handle, because if a button for forward and backward are replaced by “u” and “B”, you don’t know, what it means.</p>\n<p>in iMessage, Apple lockdown mode also restricts the documents, which can be sent. You can send someone simple pictures (jpg), but no .zip or pdf or anything else. Here, Apple seems to believe, that some other formats than jpg are extremly dangerous and hard to handle, security-wise.</p>\n<p>Only Signal team can say, if all this would make any sense for the iOS version of Signal.</p>",

The point is: we know about a couple iMessage exploits, with the most sophisticated being of course <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FORCEDENTRY\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ForcedEntry</a></em>, we know about at least one WhatsApp <a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-36934\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">vulnerability</a> that was <em>exploited in the wild</em>. But we have no evidence that was ever the case with Signal.</p>\n<p>How does <em>Lockdown Mode</em> work?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>it blocks attachments other that photos, videos and audio messages (which, if we get to <em>that</em> level of protections (and paranoia <img src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/images/emoji/apple/wink.png?v=12\" title=\":wink:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":wink:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">), also could be maliciously exploited at some point; unless Apple has rewritten those parts of the OS in Swift (or other memory-safe language)) | What <em>could</em> Signal do here? Nothing really. Because there’s no way Signal’s server could enforce <em>no attachments policy</em>, as it doesn’t know the content of a message… And any client-side locks wouldn’t help, because if my payload, ahem, message <img src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/images/emoji/apple/wink.png?v=12\" title=\":wink:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":wink:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> has arrived on your phone, it’s game over.</li>\n<li>incoming FaceTime calls are blocked unless you have previously called that person or contact | In Signal’s case you cannot call someone that hasn’t accepted your message request. In short, just <em>don’t call or message someone you suspect could infect you with Pegasus</em> <img src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/images/emoji/apple/rofl.png?v=12\" title=\":rofl:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":rofl:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">\n</li>\n<li>most importantly they “harden” Safari/WebKit by disabling just-in-time compilation for JavaScript, WebRTC, third party fonts, among other things since most vulnerabilities have this magic sentence in their CVE description <em>“Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution.”</em>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To sum it all up: out of <a href=\"https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/memory-safety/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Chromium vulnerabilities</a> 70% are memory safety related. That’s why it’s important we migrate to languages that provide (more or absolute) memory safety, like Swift, Kotlin and Rust (<img src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/images/emoji/apple/heart.png?v=12\" title=\":heart:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":heart:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">).
