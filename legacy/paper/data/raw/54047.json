        "cooked": "<p>As a programmer, to be frank, the “war against bots” is as futile and pointless and counter-productive as the “war against drugs”.</p>\n<p>The only difference between a bot, and a person with a computer is… a time delay. Programs are just “canned human behavior”. And that includes current machine learning (and is exactly why it <em>isn’t</em> AI).</p>\n<p>I’ve worked quite a bit on this “problem”, and the final conclusion is, that <strong>the core fallacy is to assume there’s anyone who <em>isn’t</em> a bot</strong>. Factually, you cannot ever tell if someone is a human, especially nowadays, where the faked intelligence of machine learning scams (like ChatGPT) and the real intelligence of certain humans clearly overlap. And it’s neither necessary nor beneficial to do so either. Besides, at what point does it become a bot anyway? Is a timed/delayed message a bot? Is my PC coming from standby in the morning, going online, and Signal Desktop then submitting a message, making it look like I was online then, a bot? Is a passive-thinking by-choice-not-a-person human, being instructed to copy-paste the word of its leader, a bot? Is my hand with its reflexes or my programmable keyboard a bot?</p>\n<p>One is much better suited by designing the system in a way that empowers <em>everyone</em> to “have a bot”. Because the automation is the the only advantage of bots, and it’s only an advantage <em>because</em> it is made a taboo and not everyone is enabled to use that. When the whole point of a computer <em>is</em> automation.<br>\nWhen everybody has the advantage, … then nobody does.</p>\n<p>And in general, automation of information processing is one of greatest inventions humanity ever had. Bigger than even the wheel. To then go and treat it stepmotherly, equals not enabling people to use almost a superpower that they already have available.<br>\nI’d go so far as to say that any software that isn’t designed with automation in mind is fundamentally mis-designed and at worst, harmful to humanity. Smartphones being the single biggest prime example.</p>\n<p>Yeah, like with drugs, if you embrace it, at least you can control it. And drugs aren’t just bad on principle either. Otherwise pharmacies and half of practical medicine wouldn’t exist.</p>\n<p><strong>Bot? Legalize it!</strong></p>\n<p>P.S.: There is one other option, but you’re not gonna like it either:</p>\n<p>If you take the scientific definition of existence and reality, where: 1. the definition of existence is that you can <em>tell</em> (e.g. measure it), because if not then what’s the point; and 2. reality is relative; then…<br>\nIf you really want to be sure that who you are talking to is a human (or you can’t ever tell that it isn’t, which is the same thing), then you need a classical network of personal real-world (afk/offline) trust relationships. As in: You have to have met the person in, well, person, and, only there, established the authenticated channel of communiation. (And I’m going way beyond some automagic code on an automagic device, made by people you never met and might as well be bots, authenticating it, like Signal does. I mean the people <em>themselves</em> authenticating it all, keys, algorithms, hardware, down to making their own chips with their own machines made from scratch to prevent dopant-level hardware trojans [yes, that is a real thing].)<br>\nAnd any person you haven’t met but are chatting to, only being as real as the person you <em>have</em> met, via which you got to know that other person, <em>says</em> they are.<br>\nSo obviously not suitable for ever verifying that random “person” (better say “account”) on the Internet. Because, as I said: You never can. (Anyone claiming otherwise, can’t actually tell reality from delusion.)</p>\n<p>I’d prefer that solution. Since all the hate of the Internet stems from humans only being able to have empathy for humans they can see as actual people. Which requires having actually met them, and staying well below Dunbar’s number. (In short: On the Internet, everyone’s a psychopath aka sociopath. [Yeah, according to the ICD, they’re really the same thing.] So the “global village” is actually a toxic dystopia that will destroy humanity; as anyone can clearly see nowadays.)</p>",

        "cooked": "<p>A good way to add bots, if possible, while limiting spam is to make official bot accounts unable to create messaging channels/groups (so someone needs to add/message the bot for the bot to be used, perhaps deauthorized if safety number of a DM changes unless added again). These bots can also only be permitted to read/send messages (to avoid call spam) and have unique identifiers (not usernames, a random string unless officially supported by Signal) as opposed to mobile numbers. They can interact with the account through an encrypted API with a token associated to the bot account.</p>\n<p>Maybe each bot can be associated to an account, so that there is some accountability for bots.

Allow ~ 1,000 credits/h for free, one request being 1-5 credits. If someone wants to make more powerful bots, they can buy credits cheaply (no profit intended). Most spammers won’t bother paying any money as it could identify them by their payment info. Also, there should be a Report Spam feature for bots, so if a handful of users report one within 24h, the bot can be disabled and the owner banned, not being able to make any other bots with his payment info.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"justsignal\" data-post=\"1\" data-topic=\"54047\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/j/b2d939/48.png\" class=\"avatar\"> justsignal:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>meta data collection</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>If you mean that bots can read messages and save them externally, the app could warn users before starting a chat or adding them to groups.

As Signal shifts more towards a social media app, demand for features like this will grow. Some people might want to use Signal exclusively for simple private messaging, and that’s okay. But it’s important to keep in mind that most mainstream users will actually like these features and shift away from Telegram. The Signal community needs to be louder and more open to change in order to convince devs to build an official bot feature.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"pseudonymous\" data-post=\"4\" data-topic=\"54047\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/p/50afbb/48.png\" class=\"avatar\"> pseudonymous:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>make official bot accounts unable to create messaging channels/groups</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>Sounds like a great idea! Signal clients can simply not show any message requests from bots that haven’t been added to Contacts before. Telegram does the same I think. You would need to hit Start or type /start to start a msg channel. If you wanna stop, you can hit Stop and Delete. For groups, bots will have to be added by admins and can then also message members privately. When the bot gets removed, the Contact also get deleted for everyone and the bot stops.</p>",

The lack of official support for bots pushes people to the Discord’s and Slack’s of the world, but everyone I need to notify is already on Signal.  When a more challenging aspect of being  Signal user tends to be getting a critical mass of people to actually use it, it sucks to have to have to send people elsewhere for this kind of thing.</p>",

Outsourcing proof of identity to the traditional telecom apparatus at best just introduces a minimal amount of friction to the process.</p>\n<p>But because I’m stubborn and opinionated it’s friction I’d rather not engage with. <img src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/images/emoji/apple/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=12\" title=\":slightly_smiling_face:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slightly_smiling_face:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>",
