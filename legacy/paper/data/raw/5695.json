This is how Snapchat messages work (except that Snapchat also deletes messages more quickly). The point of keeping the saved messages on <em>each</em> phone, to me, is to keep each person on the same page.</p>\n<p><strong>I think this would make it much easier to avoid keeping messages forever</strong> (and also reduces the need for backups).

        "cooked": "<p>Far be it from me to like something that snapchat does… but well, in this case I think I like it.  Rather than calling it “save” though I think we should call it “keep” … when I longpress or rightclick on a message that contains a file-attachment, when I tell signalapp to ‘save’ that what I expect to happen is that the attached file will be saved to the local filesystem of the device.  By contrast, when I say ‘keep’ from the same context-menu, that means I do not want the message to get deleted… either by myself or by a previously-configured automated process, in this case the disappearing-messages-timer.</p>\n<p>I think this is different from ‘pinning’ a message as well, which is a distinct feature-request (e.g. in a groupchat a pinned-message would always appear at the bottom of the groupchat for all participants, such as a warning or a link to the groupchat-rules or whatever).  By contrast, a message that is marked as kept, in a groupchat with disappearing messages, will be kept from disappearing, and also kept where it is, in the chronological chat-history ordering.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"wilson\" data-post=\"1\" data-topic=\"5695\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/w/96bed5/48.png\" class=\"avatar\"> wilson:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>if either party chooses to save a message, the message remains on each phone until both choose to unsave it</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>I dislike that… deleting a message, ought to be a separate step, from un-keeping a message.  At the moment, in a chat with no disappearing messages configured, if I want to delete a message, it is deleted on <em>one</em> single device only:  so for instance, if I delete it from the chat-history on my signal4android, the corresponding copy of that same just-deleted message over on my signal4desktop is <em>not</em> also deleted (because delete-actions do not sync across my linked devices), nor it is deleted on my contact’s device-or-devices (because they control their own message-copies).</p>\n<p>So I would prefer it if, in a 1-on-1 chat, one person can mark a particular message as Kept … but if the other side of the chat wishes to, they can manually delete the message in question just like usual, whether or not another party has marked that same message as Kept.  Definitely we want, when Alice and Bob are in a chat with disappearing configured, and Bob marks a message as Kept, that Alice should be <em>alerted</em> to the fact.  And I think, that it makes sense, for Alice’s devices to also – unless Alice says otherwise – to follow Bob’s lead and treat the message as Kept on Alice’s side once Bob marked it.  If at some point Alice wishes to mark <em>her</em> side of the conversation as no-longer-Kept, she should be able to.  Similarly, if Alice wishes to flat out manually delete <em>her</em> side of the conversation, she should also be able to do that.  We don’t want Bob to mark a giant file-attachment as Kept, and thereby clog up Alice’s older smartphone with limited storage-space, against her will.</p>\n<p>Once you have a 99-person groupchat, with the ability to mark messages as Kept, you also do not want one groupchat-member to be able to keep all messages when the other 98 folks are preferring them to be disappeared … that is why the group turned on Disappearing in the first place, presumably!</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"wilson\" data-post=\"1\" data-topic=\"5695\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/w/96bed5/48.png\" class=\"avatar\"> wilson:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>point of keeping the saved messages on <em>each</em> phone, to me, is to keep each person on the same page</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>There are some definite risks here, when it comes to privacy; we don’t want to have the simplicity of disappearing-messages, get over-complicated with the ability to mark some of them Kept… especially when a relatively old message is about to get deleted, there is a race-condition where Bob marks it as Kept just a couple seconds before it disappears, and then on Alice’s device the message is already disappeared by the time Bob’s mark-as-Kept sync-receipt arrives.  And of course, Bob can put his device into airplane mode, mark something as kept, wait a couple hours until it has disappeared on all 98 other groupchat devices, and then reconnect to the internet.</p>\n<p>In general though, signalapp assumes that all groupchat members, and even more generally that all contacts with your phone num, are trustworthy.  Bob need not abuse race-conditions in the Kept feature… he can always just copy-n-paste or take a screenshot or whatever, to keep a record without notifying Alice and the others.  But we <em>do</em> need to take some care, that the Kept feature is not surprising/shocking, in the “expected” situations where one party makes a move and then the other party finds out only later about it.</p>\n<p>I still think that all conversations, both 1-on-1 and groupchat, should default to messages being retained forever.  But I do agree that offering the ability to mark a message as Kept, will <em>significantly</em> improve the likelihood that people will turn on Disappearing, which is probably a good thing for the overall endgoal of thwarting mass dragnet surveillance.  The endpoints are the weakest link in the chain, and disappearing the messages off those endpoints, is thus a very helpful step in the right direction.</p>",

An alternative would be to require a handshake to “keep” a message, preventing \"keep\"ing when disconnected from the internet or when the message already been deleted on the other user’s phone. Preventing \"keep\"ing a message shortly before it’s destroyed could make this a rare issue. (For this casual form of disappearing messages, I think long timers like 24-hours make sense.)</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"5_c_d\" data-post=\"2\" data-topic=\"5695\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/5/35a633/48.png\" class=\"avatar\"> 5_c_d:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And I think, that it makes sense, for Alice’s devices to also – unless Alice says otherwise – to follow Bob’s lead and treat the message as Kept on Alice’s side once Bob marked it.

Similarly, if Alice wishes to flat out manually delete <em>her</em> side of the conversation, she should also be able to do that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>Agreed, and it’s a good point that Alice should control what actually remains on her phone.

E.g. enabling it (1) for all disappearing messages, or if that’s undesirable (2) as an additional option when using Disappearing Messages, or (3) enabling it when the Disappearing Messages timer is, let’s say, 24 hours or more. Adding a new “messaging mode” adds complexity. E.g., messages that were sent to disappear but chosen to be kept would be distinct from messages with no timer at all, which presents a design challenge.</p>\n<p><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/intentionaltypo\">@IntentionalTypo</a>, IMO the discussion of screenshot/copying prevention should be in a separate topic as it’s not related to the proposed feature.

        "cooked": "<p>I’m guessing it can be disabled in the same fashion as location-tracking can be disabled  <img src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/images/emoji/apple/wink.png?v=6\" title=\":wink:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":wink:\">   For quality assurance purposes, google may need to turn on all the microphones and cameras of all android devices, to send voiceprints and face-recognition test-patters to the mothership, I suppose…</p>\n<p>Signalapp is not sandboxed from <strong>the OS</strong> it is just sandboxed (<em>by</em> the OS) from other apps.  Screenshot-function is provided by the OS, and if the OS permits, can be disabled within the app – there are a few messenger apps which try to provide this, using android overlay tricks and such.  But as noted up above by PiCob, and kind of “signalapp will promise to tell you if somebody on the other end makes a backup copy of this message” is <em>definitely</em> going to cause a false sense of security.  It is a promise which cannot be (heh!) kept.</p>\n<p>Which leads us right back into the idea that started this thread:  Alice sends a message to Bob, and signalapp says (implicitly) that “I promise to disappear this message in $oneWeek after it is marked-as-being-read from every device with a copy” or whatever the timer is set for.  That promise cannot be kept, if any of the devices is maliciously altered/controlled.  But it is considered ‘okay’ to make that promise because there are not many corner-cases, it is a simple-to-grok promise, and it is also simple to implement (no inter-device coordination needed… they all know the intended deletion-time and the when-marked-as-read time for their own local copy and thus all devices can individually enforce the disappear-event).</p>\n<p>With the idea of a Kept message, it gets hairy quickly:  what if Bob notices the timer is about to expire, and decides on the spur of the moment to mark a message as Kept before it goes away?  Well, that leads to Alice getting frustrated:  <strong>she</strong> thought signalapp promised her the message in question would disappear.  If Alice is offline at the time because her battery ran flat, she might not even <em>get</em> any notice that Bob did the longpress &gt; Keep thing, until it is too late (i.e. until Alice’s device has already disappeared <em>her</em> copy of the message in question).  In which case, now Bob is frustrated as well:  he wanted to save that message, because he had something more to say to Alice about it, and she no longer has it on her end.  Plus is angry at Bob for keeping-without-telling-her.  Suddenly, everybody was kung-fu fighting, in other words  <img src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/images/emoji/apple/slight_smile.png?v=6\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\"></p>\n<p>I thought about the idea of doing something complicated, along the lines of preventing-Bob-from-tapping-Keep-when-the-disappear-is-about-to-occur, but that of course is EXACTLY when Bob will be maximally frustrated at being unable to Keep, as he knows it is now or never.  And it <em>is</em> complicated… to me even something as long as 30-minute-no-go-zone would be a <em>long</em> timespan, whereas Wilson suggests more like a 24-hour-no-go-zone for the Keep-just-before-a-Disappear-happens thing.  Alice and Bob probably have their own ideas, differing from each other and from us.  I will think on this some more.  But we need to see if we can find some specific use-cases where (A) disappearing messages are in use and for a specific reason, which (B) needs to be overridden from time to time, that (C) are use-cases that everyday citizens might run into, not just super-spies and political-dissidents and such folks.</p>\n<p>The usual situation for one-off-disappearing, is Alice sets the timer, sends Bob a login-password, and then unsets the timer.  The usual situation for perma-disappearing, is that Alice and/or Bob have limited phone-storage-capacity, and want to avoid filling it up with a bunch of ephemeral media-files they have already viewed (i.e. the snapchat use-case).  If they want to ‘keep’ one more permanently, then they download-and-save it to their local filesystem… which means it gets decrypted and exfiltrated from the secure perimeter of signalapp.  So maybe, one of the use-cases is that Alice and Bob are exchanging sensitive large files, such as accounting-spreadsheets… but those cannot be viewed nor edited within signalapp, they have to be saved to the filesystem (and by default a stock android smartphone will immediately upload the spreadsheet to google-docs).  If they are exchanging sensitive audio/video/imagefiles however, such as brainstorming a new product-design in their employee design-team groupchat…</p>\n<p>well, that is a very plausible scenario.  Only some of the 99 design-videos will be worth marking as Kept.  Even a spacious flash-nand capacity would be filled up if all design-videos were kept.  Alice and Bob may differ on which videos are worth keeping, but will want to know what the other one liked enough to Keep.  Corporate security policy will dictate that they should not save the design-videos to their smartphone filesystem raw, but must retain them with the sqlCipher region only.  And to make sure that this happens, and that it is convenient for Alice and Bob to remain on the same page, my suggestion would be to have the UI/UX work as follows:</p>\n<p>Alice and Bob swap 99 design-videos with each other in their work-groupchat, during the M-F workweek.  Along the way, when they are not busy on other tasks, and not busy sending out a new design-video, they review the videos sent by other folks.  Videos they wish to stick around, they can mark as Kept in their own device, by longpress and then tapping ‘Keep’ (which might look like an icon of a closed fist crushing an hourglass or something to indicate that disappearing-messages-will-be-disabled-for-the-kept-message).  Then, what happens next is similar to a quoted-reply:  when Alice selects video#11 of 99 and taps Keep, the other groupchat participants including Bob will receive a normal signal-message at the bottom of the chat-history, with the message Alice selected as the quoted-reply portion, and with the boilerplate phrase ‘marked as Kept (thus will not Disappear)’ or something, in the caption-portion.</p>\n<p>This is fairly straightforward to implement… and fairly straightforward to understand, for Bob and Alice, methinks.  When Bob taps on video#22 of 99 and marks it ‘Keep’ then a message from him goes out, with <span class=\"hashtag\">#22</span> in the quoted-reply-portion, and the same boilerplate text-explanation.  Basically, this is an automated two-tap shortcut of the following steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bob disables disappearing-messages timer</li>\n<li>Bob scrolls through the chat-history</li>\n<li>Bob longpresses video#22</li>\n<li>Bob taps the quoted-reply icon</li>\n<li>Bob manually types ‘keeping this one’ as the caption-message</li>\n<li>Bob taps the send-message-icon</li>\n<li>Bob re-enables the disappearing messages timer</li>\n<li>Bob manually re-specifies the same timer-value as before</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And cuts all that down to just:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bob scrolls through the chat-history</li>\n<li>Bob longpresses video#22</li>\n<li>Bob taps the Keep icon</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is not quite ‘perfect’ because it means that the kept-message(s) will not be able to be kept-in-place, they will be duplicated (in terms of body-content but not in terms of timer-metadata and such) further down the chat-history.  But I like this approach, because it handles most corner-cases:  we do not need to worry about Alice being offline, and Bob keeping something, and Alice getting frustrated… Bob’s actions will <em>always</em> be clear to everybody.  (The only exception would be a situation where Alice was in a groupchat with Bob, and Alice clicked LeaveGroup prior to Bob clicking Keep.)</p>",
