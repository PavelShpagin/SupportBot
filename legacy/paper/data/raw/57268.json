        "cooked": "<p>Suddenly, without warning, today I cannot send (and presumably receive) messages anymore. The Signal app displays “This version of Signal has expired. Update now to send and receive messages.”</p>\n<p>This is bad UX because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>there was no timely warning that this will happen</li>\n<li>there is no explanation as to why this happens</li>\n<li>it forces the user into alternative, insecure, communication channels in case updating the app is not feasable</li>\n<li>considering I’m on v6.30.* and the current version is v6.40.*, there should be no backwards incompatibility, therefore I feel like I’m forced to jump through hoops for no valid reason. I’d argue that blocking the app isn’t reasonable even if there was a known security vulnerability in my version.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Suggestion for improvement:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>never take control away from the user (if want that I’ll stick to Facebook Messenger)</li>\n<li>warn the user (every 30 days?) that their app is behind with the updates</li>\n<li>if the core app functionality (sending messages) is no longer compatible with the server, the user should be informed and asked to update</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Somebody else having this issue: <a href=\"https://community.signalusers.org/t/wrong-date-settings-on-phone-this-version-of-signal-has-expired/49642\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Wrong date settings on phone: \"This version of Signal has expired\"</a></p>\n<p>Gippity is more well-spoken and has some additional note-worthy considerations regarding why this could be considered bad UX:</p>\n<details>\n<summary>\nSummary</summary>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Unexpected Disruption</strong>: Users generally expect continuity in their app usage. A sudden expiration of the app version can disrupt their communication unexpectedly, which can be particularly problematic in urgent or important situations.</li>\n<li><strong>Forced Update</strong>: This approach forces users to update the app immediately to continue using it. Users may not always be in a position to update the app instantly due to various reasons like limited data availability, being in the middle of an important conversation, or using an older device that might not support the latest update.</li>\n<li><strong>Lack of Prior Warning</strong>: A good UX design involves informing users well in advance about any significant changes that could impact their usage. If users are not warned about the impending expiration of their app version, they can be caught off guard.</li>\n<li><strong>Potential Accessibility Issues</strong>: Some users might face challenges in updating apps due to reasons like lack of familiarity with the process, limited internet access, or restrictions due to device capabilities. Forcing an update without providing alternatives or assistance can exclude these users.</li>\n<li><strong>Trust and Perception</strong>: This kind of abrupt change can affect the user’s trust in the app. Users might perceive the app as unreliable or feel that their needs are not being considered, which can lead to frustration or even abandonment of the app.</li>\n<li><strong>Update Size and Data Constraints</strong>: If the update is large in size, it might be inconvenient for users with limited data plans or slow internet connections.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n</details>",
