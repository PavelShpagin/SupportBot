Signal is at the end of the day a niche app with a passionate user base who takes privacy seriously, the majority of other user bases use other apps because of convenience or inertia/network effect, not because of a rational choice. Therefore giving your user base insights into this would help understand the future of an app where they are invested.</p>",

My wish is to know which features will be done or won’t be done (and ideally why not) to form an idea of the future of the app and the rate of change it’ll have.</p>\n<p>I’ve noticed that after years of using Signal is still hard (but easier than before) to convince people to start using it or even keep using it because there isn’t enough network effect and/or is missing features. The network effect gets worsened if there aren’t enough features to maintain and attract new users. So basically having desirable features is a key component.<br>\nI don’t know the plans with Signal but if it is to reach more people, then having desirable features - as long as they align with the mission of “enable secure global communication through open source privacy technology” - is a must. Otherwise that “global communication” is just “niche groups communication”; can’t be global if you don’t cater a global audience. But again, I don’t know if that is the objective.</p>\n<p>Knowing which features have been assessed at least allows me to evaluate the level of invest and effort in the long term with Signal and being able to say to people I am telling about Signal: “Hey John, this feature you want isn’t there yet, but there are plans to add it in 3 months, top”.</p>",

Signal is at the end of the day a niche app with a passionate user base who takes privacy seriously, the majority of other user bases use other apps because of convenience or inertia/network effect, not because of a rational choice. Therefore giving your user base insights into this would help understand the future of an app where they are invested.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/sigfun\">@sigfun</a> I can’t more agree with you.
