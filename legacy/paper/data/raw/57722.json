I read Signal’s blog post on the costs of running Signal and I have an idea that can not only save Signal millions of dollars in costs but actually provide a revenue stream.</p>\n<p>The idea is this: instead of using phone numbers, just use public / private key pairs and for spam-filtration, use proof-of-work, the same mechanism that Bitcoin uses. Submit this proof of work to a mining pool to get paid in Bitcoin.</p>\n<p>So instead of asking for the phone number and sending an OTP, which costs about $6m / year, you should instead give the user a proof-of-work challenge, which is basically a request for the client to provide a nonce that, when appended to some relevant block of data and hashed, results in a sufficiently-small hash output. The definition of sufficiently-small would be tuned so that a typical phone / client could do it in 15 seconds. The client does this, sends to the server, the server then checks that the nonce satisfies the hash challenge, and approves or disapproves. You can filter out all spam from users trying to consume too many server resources. It can be applied to any user action, from creating an account to sending a message to deleting a message. You can tune the amount of work for different user actions. Maybe it takes 30s of work to create a user account, but only 1s to send a message.</p>\n<p>The original use case for proof-of-work was spam-filtration on emails, because the amount of work per email was small enough that sending a few emails a day wasn’t a problem, but sending millions was. Then this technique was applied to Bitcoin mining. The sufficiently-small definition there self-adjusts so that the mining-network finds a new block about every 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>So here’s where you can actually start making money, instead of paying $6m / year to legacy phone carriers who hate you. Mining pools work by serving easier versions of the hashing challenge to the miners. If the sufficiently-small definition to mint a new block is 10-zeros at the beginning, relax it to 5-zeros. Then when miners submit solutions to the relaxed challenge, it is proof that they were, well, working on it. But every once in a while one of the solutions to the relaxed challenge will also be a solution to the new-block-challenge, so a new block is mined with newly minted Bitcoin as a reward, which is then distributed pro-rata to all the miners in the pool, according to how many solutions to the relaxed challenge they submitted.</p>\n<p>You can turn the swarm of clients trying to verify phone numbers into a Bitcoin mining pool. All you have to do is serve easier versions of actual bitcoin-mining challenges in the same way that mining pools work. There are some technical hurdles here since the client challenges would have to be easier than the typical relaxed-miner-challenge but it is in principle easy to do with minimal infrastructure.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in pursuing this, I can help.</p>",

If we scale this method to an arbitrary with some serious resources, let’s say 10000USD (which is not that much, if we are talking about the US Government), they could create 37000 spam accounts. You can easily see how overwhelming a whistleblower tip-line with this amount of fake accounts wouldn’t be that difficult, and there’s cheaper ways to rent a computer to generate Signal accounts.</p>",

In addition, set-up of an account would take more time, which would make some users abandon the process alltogether.<br>\nAll in all, PoW is not a good method to prevent spam when your clients have to run on mobile devices</p>"
