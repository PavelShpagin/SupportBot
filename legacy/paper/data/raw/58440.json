It looks and feels so bad it lend me to believe I downloaded an unofficial desktop port of Signal that has 10 stars on Github.<br>\nI like Signal, and I’d like to use it because Telegram is honestly killing itself off. But the desktop client for this app is so bad its making me prefer Telegram and their ad-infested desktop client.</p>\n<p>Theming matters a lot in showing your brand’s identity, and this client does not feel like a comfy friendly place I could chat and meet friends on. This client feels very monotone and clinical, like it screams its some place I’d discuss crypto-related scandals and buy NFTs on while talking to my 50 year old co-workers about what new company we should hold for ransom. Does not feel like a place I’d talk with friends on about some new movie or game coming out.<br>\nTelegram’s client feels unprofessional in a friendly way, highly customizable, comfortable, and ad-infested but we’ll ignore that part.<br>\nThis client feels monotone, following some Google Material design I’ve seen in 50 other apps, off-brand, and very uninspired. This app’s UI art style has no identity and feels poorly thrown together. It bothers me and many users.</p>\n<p>This client looks and feels less official than Telegram’s unofficial community-built clients, and it feels like it hasn’t seen the light of a git commit in years despite it being actively well maintained.</p>\n<p>I’d go as far as recommending a full rewrite, as a lot of people have already been requesting ditching Electron and rewriting the app in Qt or Tauri in another thread. The desktop client has a lot of problems besides “it lacks theming support and it’s ugly” (even though it is), such as the fact it barely has any settings, the fact it requires you to use your phone to sign in or make an account. Wallpapers are also not supported, which are supported in the mobile apps … this is a parity feature that is so easy to implement I could do it in 10-20 minutes.</p>\n<p>UI identity and art style is another fight Telegram wins, and I do not want Telegram to win it.<br>\n<img src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/images/emoji/apple/clap.png?v=12\" title=\":clap:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":clap:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> Give Signal the desktop client it deserves <img src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/images/emoji/apple/clap.png?v=12\" title=\":clap:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":clap:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>",

        "cooked": "<p>For the default theme I have a couple ideas that could make it better and more friendly/unique</p>\n<p>I’d recommend:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Getting rid of the menu bar at the top left on Windows &amp; Linux, making it be a dropdown menu when you click the signal logo. I’d also recommend maybe making a title (window control) bar a non-native one with the native one being optional.</li>\n<li>Making everything slightly bigger by default, and making the tab icons on the left less horizontally spread out <em>(its very asymmetrical)</em></li>\n<li>Optionally getting rid of the “Chats”, “Calls”, “Stories” in the top left and getting rid of that bar entirely, combining the new chat and new call functions with the search bar. The padding/margins are also very inconsistent in that top left section.</li>\n<li>Generally making the UI feel less cluttered, which is basically what my recommendations are up until this point.</li>\n<li>I’d recommend perhaps having some form of theme colour. Discord tints every grey towards a slight blue or red, and Telegram straight up makes everything blue. I’d recommend making the greys a bit darker on everything except the chat panel so there’s more contrast and it feels a bit more sleek</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the settings menu I’d recommend a complete redesign, because having it open up a separate unresizable window feels out of the ordinary compared to platforms like Discord and Telegram, and even compared to Signal, as clicking on your profile picture presents your profile inside a virtual popup inside the main Signal window.<br>\nThe buttons on the left also have no hover effect, and the window generally feels clunky and inconsistent <em>(it even flashes white when it’s open, even on a mid-spec system. its common practice to hide a window until electron detects the content loaded)</em><br>\nI’d recommend going the Telegram / Signal mobile app route by making the settings pop up in a virtual popup that only shows the settings categories; when clicked, showing the settings from the respective category you clicked on.</p>\n<p>Those are all tweaks I feel would separate Signal from that sterile GitHub Desktop theme and make the interface look cleaner and less cluttered.<br>\nThough, adding in theming and background images alone would go a long way. (especially the background images)<br>\nThere could even be some official user theme browser inside the app itself, which is something even Telegram doesn’t do.</p>\n<p>I’ve also found Signal in general to be lacking settings and customization on both desktop and mobile. The settings and “your profile” menus feel particularly empty, especially/specifically on desktop.<br>\nIf you compare Signal’s privacy settings page with Telegram’s privacy settings page it’s like a night and day difference. Signal in general lacks settings, and even though I haven’t noticed I’m missing anything as I haven’t been using Signal much, it just feels weird and makes Signal and the desktop client feel underdeveloped.</p>",

There are VLC Media Player power users and its the number one reason a literal media player has theming and extension support. A FLIPPIN MEDIA PLAYER.<br>\nI’ve seen people risk breaking the desktop app just to add in some form of theming, eagerly awaiting Signal to add in theming officially.<br>\nPower users exist, users on other platforms such as Discord will risk getting banned just to theme and have access to plugins and extra settings. If Signal were to launch an extension/theming platform, there would be plenty users making extensions and themes even just for themselves. Those are power users.</p>\n<p>The majority of Linux users are power-users.<br>\nYou could <em>maybe</em> even count most Signal users in general as power users, using a less mainstream chatting app for the sake of privacy is a bit of a power-usery thing to do.</p>\n<p>Not everyone cares about theming, but it’s something that is always cared about regardless of the app. If someone uses an app for a long time, it’s very common to want the app to feel and look like whatever they consider as better. It’s why you make your real life room look the way it does, because you spend a lot of time in it.<br>\nA lot of Signal contributors likely use theming in their IDEs. Contributors are also power users.</p>\n<p>There’s an option to disable the menu bar regardless of platform, I reckoned it should be disabled by default. Especially since this app makes the menu bar show on hover even when its hidden <em>(which is actually very cool I’ve never seen it done anywhere else, no requirement to hold the alt key)</em><br>\nThough, it tends to sometimes stick around after alt+tabbing in and out of the app like it was never hidden in the first place.</p>",
