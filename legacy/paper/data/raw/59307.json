        "cooked": "<p>Hello!</p>\n<p>I have a feature request for Signal notifications. I would like for Signal to have the option to set 1:1 and group chats to only send the notification; “You have unread notifications.” until the chat is viewed. I would like this setting to have a global option in notification settings, but I would also like it to be available individually in the notification settings for chats, similar to how disappearing messages has a global and per-chat option.</p>\n<p><strong>Who would be interested in this?</strong><br>\nPeople who would be interested in this are those who use Signal group chats in an attempt to replace group chats from other platforms. However, I commonly find my family and friends are actively discouraged from using Signal due to how often messages trigger notifications. This feature would allow people to see if a chat has been active on a per chat basis.</p>\n<p>Another group of people who would be interested in this are those who have friends who simply <em>do not</em> understand the concept of a complete sentence and break up what they say into small messages, or those who spam memes and videos to you like crazy.</p>\n<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong><br>\nThis matters because many use Signal in an attempt to get away from less privacy-respective platforms. These platforms include Discord and Snapchat, where people commonly have long conversations with one another. Without this feature, such conversation is heavily discouraged as to not annoy the other members of the group chat. Adding his feature will show people that conversation is taking place in their group chats, but only once. The notification sits in the notification pane, waiting for people to tap on it (or to view it from another device), rather than notifying them for almost every message.</p>\n<p>The current ability to make the chat only notify for @ does not work effectively as a solution to this problem, both because there is a notable lack of @ everyone, causing you to have to have to @ everybody individually, and because people will either forget or be annoyed that this is required.</p>\n<p><strong>What kind of responses do you want?</strong><br>\nI would like feedback from the community about how well this idea is received, as well as how this idea could be tweaked to better fit the needs of people who use SIgnal.<br>\nI would also like feedback and opinions from devs about if and when we could see something akin to this functionality implemented.</p>\n<p>I apologize in advance if this issue has been asked about prior. I have looked at other feature requests and noticed similar functionality such as rate-limited notifications, but I have not seen much recent activity in those posts regarding this idea. I believe this will near exponentially increase the viability of Signal group chats as a suitable replacement for other platforms. This feature would also pair nicely with the group call feature; “Turn off ringing”, which prevents everyone in the chat from getting call.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your time.</p>",

        "cooked": "<p>This, much like the ability to mute chats except for @, feels like only a temporary solution to the main issue. This feature appears to work per app, either for all notifications from that app, or certain notifications marked as conversations, not really on a per chat level within Signal. This feature will also reset the volume of notifications after an unknown waiting period. “You have unread notifications.” will notify once (or based on someone’s “repeat alerts” setting) and remain in the notification screen until you want to tap or dismiss it.</p>\n<p>In my opinion, Signal should not be relying on the OS to do this for them, especially since many versions of android will not get this feature for quite some time. They should also not be relying upon the caring users to tell the users that do not care or want it to just work out of the box ‘what and where’ the feature is, it can come off to the user as poor design.</p>\n<p>These stopgap choices put strain on those who already barely tolerate Signal as is, and can discourage those who love Signal as they might lose contacts or actively limit themselves from talking so they don’t annoy other people.</p>\n<p>I appreciate your feedback, nonetheless.</p>",
