        "cooked": "<p>Can you explain more, what you are suggesting?  There are some feature-requests already which are similar, but not identical, to what it sounds like you are asking about.</p>\n<details>\n<summary>\npinned-welcome-msg, pinned-perma-msg, reaction-emoji, annotation-tagging</summary>\n<p>There is a feature-request to allow a message to be ‘pinned’ (sometimes called stickied), which is mostly applicable to groupchats.  When a message is <a href=\"https://community.signalusers.org/t/welcome-message-for-groups/2299\">pinned-welcome</a>, it automatically appears at the top of the (blank) chat-history whenever a new member is added to the groupchat.  Very different:  when a message is <a href=\"https://community.signalusers.org/t/contacts-refuse-to-use-signal-because-it-lacks-many-things/4256/22\">pinned-permanently</a>, it automatically appears at the bottom of the chat-history at <em>all</em> times, for all groupchat members, where it basically hovers over the send-message-textarea (or over the quoted-reply-preview-area when than is visible).  The pinned-welcome message is usually something like “welcome to Xyz Corp groupchat and here is the purpose and if you have any questions or problems here are the people you can contact”… it can be quite long, and might span multiple 2000-byte chat-bubbles.  The pinned-permanently message by contrast is typically quite short, usually just a sentence-fragment or two:  “No leaks.  Be courteous.  Cf our <a href=\"https://community.signalusers.org/about\">groupchat-rules</a>.”</p>\n<p>There is a different kind of feature-request, which is applicable to groupchats but also applicable to 1-on-1 chats, where <a href=\"https://community.signalusers.org/t/emoji-reactions/2776\">message-bubbles can have reaction-emoji</a>.  Here in signalUsers there is a limited version of that:  by clicking on the little <img src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/images/emoji/apple/heart.png?v=12\" title=\":heart:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":heart:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> thing at the bottom of a particular forum-post, you can award a ‘heart’ aka “loved it” kind of emoji-reaction to the author of the posting.  If multiple forum-participants award hearts, the heart-count for that forum-post goes upwards.  Over on <a href=\"http://github.com/signalapp\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Signal · GitHub</a> there are more options:  you can heart a github-comment, but you can also +1 and rocketShip and smiley and a half-dozen other things.</p>\n<p>This is basically a form of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(metadata)\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">controlled-vocabulary tagging-system</a>, but with emoji rather than textual-tags (such as would be common in a blogging-platform for instance).  If the reaction-emoji were implemented within signalapp, I can imagine that people would want to be able to search for chat-bubbles that were “tagged” with specific emoji, either by anybody, or by specific people.  So it would be possible, in your 1-on-1 chats and in your groupchats, to utilize your reaction-emoji as a kind of favoriting-specific-posts.  However… the main downside here is that reaction-emoji (or reaction-textual-tags) are going to be <em>public</em> by design.  If you are in a 1-on-1 chat and you put a heart-shaped reaction-emoji onto a message, both you and your chat-partner will see that heart-icon.  If you are in a 99-member groupchat and 37 people put +1 reaction-emoji on chinese food whereas 52 put +1 reaction-emoji on italian food, you are having pizza for lunch <em>and everybody knows it</em>.</p>\n</details>\n<p>The feature-request that you seem to be describing, is a means of organizing materials for your own use, later on.  If your boss sends your team-groupchat a series of long-term goals, you might want to put on a reaction-emoji that you know the boss will see (heart +1 +1 heart heart thinkingFace +1 etc).  But simultaneously, you might also want to add your own annotations, which are visible <strong>only to you</strong> and not to the rest of your team-groupchat (costly infeasible doomed ignoreThis delegateThis doomed impossible wtf doomed etc).  Here you are engaging in a kind of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_indexing\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">locally-available subject-tagging</a> and prioritization, useful later on for searching/grouping/triage efforts as you try to work through the task-list.  Similar feature would be useful in a friends&amp;family context:  you would give Auntie Alice some polite reaction-emoji for her vacation-photos, but you would add your own local annotations which described how you would <em>really</em> search for them later on (goofyExpressions unintentionallyHilarious defineIrony etc).</p>\n<p>I think it would be possible to have both reaction-emoji, as well as annotation-texts, tied to each message-bubble in a chat, at the enduser’s discretion.  Reaction-emoji could be added by longpress &gt; reaction &gt; heart &gt; ok, whereas annotations could be added by longpress &gt; annotate &gt; typing-some-text &gt; ok … but I think these can be combined more easily into a single high-speed UX.  Double-tap on a message-bubble, and above the msg-bubble you should immediately see a <em>small</em> tray of reaction-emoji (not the fullsize emoji-picker which has <em>hundreds</em>), while simultaneously below the message-bubble a small annotation-textbox should appear (with the vkeyboard already opened and ready to annotate).</p>\n<p>This UI-approach makes reacting a cinch:  you notice a message that needs a response, double-tap it, heart it, and you are done – total of two-and-a-half quick taps to react.  This is considerably faster than longpress &gt; reaction &gt; heart &gt; okBtn which takes four-and-a-half taps with considerable distance of finger-travel needed.  Annotations with more nuance than the constrained vocab of the reaction-emoji-mini-picker, can be arbitrarily complicated, but short ones take just a few speedy taps to create.   Later, when doing full-text-search, you can find all the chat-messages that you heart’d with a reaction-emoji, and also find all the chat-messages that you annotated with Feb2019 textual-tags, equally easily.</p>",

Here is the starred-messages feature-request, in a groupchat with Alice + Bob + Chuck + Dave.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alice:  &nbsp;sznoo!</li>\n<li>Bob:  &nbsp;&nbsp;uh… what’s sznoo?</li>\n<li>Alice:  &nbsp;not much, what’s new with you?  hee hee ;-)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If Chuck thinks this is mildly amusing, he has to decide… is it worth starring that message, to review this great moment in comedy?  Dave on the other hand is hysterically laughing and wishes he could give the message <em>9000</em> stars it is so funny.  But nobody else in the groupchat is able to tell, whether Dave liked the message, because only Dave can see the messages that he starred, on his own devices.  As far as Alice can tell, her attempt at making a joke fell flat.</p>\n<p>Now, if we repeat the same scenario, same 3 messages as before, same groupchat of 4 people, but with reactionEmoji and the justForMe checkbox, we have the following situation:  Bob can send the reactionEmoji <img src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/images/emoji/apple/crazy_face.png?v=12\" title=\":crazy_face:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":crazy_face:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> and leave the justForMe checkbox off (which is the default), since he thinks that is a pretty crazy joke.  Chuck has mixed emotions, but he is no longer constrained to like-or-abstain, he can give some nuance:  he sends <img src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/images/emoji/apple/slight_smile.png?v=12\" title=\":slight_smile:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":slight_smile:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"><img src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/images/emoji/apple/roll_eyes.png?v=12\" title=\":roll_eyes:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":roll_eyes:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> as a combination, but he does <em>NOT</em> then additionally need to tag the chat-bubble with <img src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/images/emoji/apple/100.png?v=12\" title=\":100:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":100:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> and JustForMe, which is Chuck’s usual way to emoji-categorize stuff he finds really funny to look back on later.  Dave meanwhile, immediately sends reactionEmoji <img src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/images/emoji/apple/laughing.png?v=12\" title=\":laughing:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":laughing:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"><img src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/images/emoji/apple/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=12\" title=\":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"><img src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/images/emoji/apple/rofl.png?v=12\" title=\":rofl:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":rofl:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> …and the longer he considers how awesome Alice’s humour was the more reactionEmoji he adds, <img src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/images/emoji/apple/star_struck.png?v=12\" title=\":star_struck:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":star_struck:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"><img src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/images/emoji/apple/joy_cat.png?v=12\" title=\":joy_cat:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":joy_cat:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"><img src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/images/emoji/apple/joystick.png?v=12\" title=\":joystick:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":joystick:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> to express his true feelings.  After checking JustForMe first, Dave also marks the <img src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/images/emoji/apple/ambulance.png?v=12\" title=\":ambulance:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":ambulance:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"> emoji on Alice’s joke, reminding himself that this one was so funny it left him in stitches and in need of a doctor.  Alice can also, if she wishes, react to the reactions, and leave her own <img src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/images/emoji/apple/bowing_woman.png?v=12\" title=\":bowing_woman:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":bowing_woman:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"><img src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/images/emoji/apple/1st_place_medal.png?v=12\" title=\":1st_place_medal:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":1st_place_medal:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">  reactionEmoji on her own message, to commemorate this moment in comedic history.</p>\n<p>The downside to reactionEmoji is that it takes two taps to react:  one to open the reactionEmoji popup, and then a 2nd tap to select a recently-used reactionEmoji.  With the starred-messages thing, only one tap is needed:  you just tap the star, and you are done.  Searching is less powerful though, because everything is either star-or-not and there is no way to do combos; reactionEmoji permit combos, can optionally offer JustForMe checkbox in the reactionEmoji-popup to prevent others from seeing the reaction in question, and can even permit a series of sequential reaction-back-n-forth</p>\n<p>Ideally though, I think it should be possible to react with an arbitrary set of text to a particular post:  thataway, instead of just one or more reactionEmoji, we give the groupchat members the power of arbitrary unicode tagging.  Dave can react with :-) or he can react with “ha!” or he can do something longer and more complex.  Tagging with keywords like “todo” is helpful, but Alice can also tag with “7/4/19” if she is working on a shopping-list for a holiday celebration.  So my first choice would be text-tagging, my second choice would be reactionEmoji with optional justForMe, and starred-messages would be okay-but-a-bit-limited.</p>",

They just don’t have anything to do with each other, each message belongs only in the context of the convrsation in which you received or send it.</p>\n<p>As an alternative to easily finding your bookmarked messages by bringing them all together, I propose to add a quick scroll button to jump directly to the next or the previous starred message. It works very similar to searching a message with a certain word in it. The search function allows you to jump from one mesage to the next, and shows you a counter of the total number of available messages eith that word. The only difference would be that you are not searching a word, but you are searching a bookmarked message.</p>\n<p>You should still be able to search only within your bookmarked messages, so the search feature should be able to filter on “search within bookmarks only”.</p>",
