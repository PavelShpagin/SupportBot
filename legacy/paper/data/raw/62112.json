        "cooked": "<p>Screen sharing is a really nice feature, and I’m really glad Signal has it. Signal’s screen sharing is just almost good enough to where I don’t need to use other platforms for screen sharing. I often run into an issue or two that forces me to switch the call to a different platform like Discord or Zoom to continue the screenshare. I think there’s 3 main improvements that could bring Signal’s screen sharing up to par with competitors.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Allow users to configure fps/resolution.</strong> This is a feature on other popular platforms like Discord. Sometimes Signal’s screenshare is literally unusable due to how bad the quality is, sometimes the resolution makes reading anything impossible, and sometimes the low fps makes watching anything impossible. Some users have reported increased quality through some hacks which the average user would not/could do. If the client can already change these parameters, then it should really be exposed to all users, not just the ones who compile Signal themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Allow multiple users to share their screen at once.</strong> I’m not sure if this is a bug or if this just isn’t supported for some reason, but I was unable to share my screen while my friend was already sharing his screen. I tested again with my other friend and we still could not both share our screens. I don’t understand why we can both share our cameras but not our screens. This makes tech support very difficult as I was guiding my friend through a problem he was having, but I could not see his screen since only one of us could share it at a time. Because of this issue, we eventually hung up on Signal and called on Discord instead.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Allow audio in screen shares</strong> This is more of a quality of life feature, but it is really nice watching videos together with your friends through a screen share. Unfortunately Signal does not allow us to do this yet.</p>\n<p>If I missed anything or got anything incorrect, please feel free to let me know. I think Signal’s screen sharing is so close to being amazing, but just needs these improvements to bring it up to speed with competitors.</p>",

I understand that it’s not meant to share screens, but it’s sad that I can’t use one platform for calls. (also I checked the code, resolution was set to max 640x480, and frame rate to min 1 max 30. I’m not a coder, so I can’t say 100% that it is like that)</p>",
