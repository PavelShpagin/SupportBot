        "cooked": "<p>Hey everyone,</p>\n<p>I’ve been a long-time user of Signal and absolutely love the app for its commitment to privacy and security. The end-to-end encryption is top-notch, and it’s clear that Signal has been leading the charge when it comes to secure messaging. However, after trying out Simplex, I noticed some significant differences in how the two apps handle local security on desktop, and it got me thinking—why doesn’t Signal implement some of these features?</p>\n<p>What Simplex Does Right:</p>\n<p>Passcode Protection: Simplex requires a passcode to access the desktop app. This adds an extra layer of security, especially in situations where someone might have physical access to your computer.</p>\n<p>Database Encryption: The local database where messages and data are stored is encrypted. So, even if someone manages to get hold of the local files, they wouldn’t be able to read your messages without the decryption key.</p>\n<p>Duress PIN: Simplex has a feature where you can set a special PIN to be used under duress. When entered, this PIN either wipes sensitive data or opens a decoy version of the app, protecting you in high-stress situations.</p>\n<p>Why Signal Should Implement These Features:</p>\n<p>Enhanced Local Security: Signal’s encryption is great for securing messages in transit, but once those messages are on your desktop, they’re vulnerable if your device gets compromised. Encrypting the local database would add a much-needed layer of security.</p>\n<p>Prevent Unauthorized Access: A passcode requirement on the Signal desktop app would prevent anyone from reading your messages if they manage to access your computer. This is crucial in shared or public environments.</p>\n<p>Protect Users Under Coercion: The duress PIN is an underrated feature that could be a lifesaver in extreme situations. Whether it’s a decoy or a data wipe, it gives users a way to protect themselves and their information when under pressure.</p>\n<p>Consistency Across Devices: Signal’s mobile app already has features like app lock and screen security, so why not extend these to the desktop app? It would provide a seamless security experience across all devices.</p>\n<p>User Expectations: As users become more security-conscious, there’s an increasing demand for apps that protect not just communication in transit but also data at rest. Implementing these features would align Signal with these growing expectations and maintain its reputation as a leader in secure messaging.</p>\n<p>Final Thoughts:</p>\n<p>Don’t get me wrong, I still think Signal is an incredible app, and I’ll continue using it. But with the rise of threats targeting local data, it’s becoming more and more important for apps to offer comprehensive security. By adopting some of the features that Simplex already has, Signal could provide an even more robust defense for our messages.</p>\n<p>What do you all think? Would you like to see Signal add these local security features to the desktop app?</p>\n<p>Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!</p>",
