        "cooked": "<p>Samsung’s fork of Android has a feature called “Dual Messenger” that allows you to create mutliple sandboxed installations of messaging apps, for the purpose of using multiple accounts for messengers that do not natively support multiple profiles.  Currently, Signal does not appear to be compatible with this feature, while WhatsApp is.  I was unable to find any documentation on how, from a developer’s perspective, to enable this feature for an app.  I suppose there is probably some Samsung support email or forum that would respond to a “where is your dual messenger API and corresponding documentation?” request from a prominent app developer.</p>\n<p>This feature request would be superfluous if <a href=\"https://community.signalusers.org/t/multiple-seperate-user-profiles-for-example-but-not-exclusive-to-dual-sim-phones/2361/10\">Multiple (separate) user profiles</a> were implemented, however I suspect that feature could take a long time to develop, while compatibility with Dual Messenger could potentially be as simple as adding a line or two to the manifest.</p>",

However, there is no added security… any person with access to the unlocked handset, can open up either of the launcher-icons.</p>\n<p>If you want to put some apps into a samsung secure folder, that <em>does</em> add a distinct password to unlock the separate compartment … methinks that samsung secure folder is their equivalent of what LineageOS / AOSP refer to as multiple android system profiles.  These can be a battery-drain and a RAM problem because they apparently stay running at all times even when you are logged into only one profile/folder, but might be compatible with signalapp already?

I have several apps in it, and you can set the same settings with regards to battery optimisation</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>Well, secure folder itself may or may not cause significant battery-drain, but when you are running two distinct signalapp installs, they have to both contact the signal-server separately.  There is a network-roundtrip when +1-111-111-1111 checks their latest messages, and a different roundtrip when +2-222-222-2222 checks <em>their</em> queue.  But they also make roundtrips to S3/Cloudfront for the profile-avatar-pictures, and such things.</p>\n<p>So although the idea of SecureFolder is definitely handy for people that want to have a “dual-sim” type setup, or a worknum+personalnum type setup, on a single handset… it is still somewhat of a workaround, because I expect it eats more battlife than it should.</p>\n<details>\n<summary>\nproper support for multiple simultaneous signal-identifiers IS better</summary>\n<p>Usually it would be preferable to have a feature where signalapp was able to handle multiple signal-identifiers internally… this might be handled with a conversation-list than handled nested-folders, like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>work +1-111-111-1111 [folder]</li>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>boss</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>teamlead</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>coworker</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>accountant</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>lawyer</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>evil maid</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>supplier</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>customer</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>personal +2-222-222-2222 [folder]</li>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>spouse</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>teenager</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>coworker (also listed under worknum)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This would result in a splitscreen layout of the conversation-list screen, where instead of being able to see 9 conversation-list items in a flat list, you would now see the top half of the conversation-list screen with the 4 most recent worknum conversations plus a scrollbar, and the bottom half of the screen with the 4 most recent personal-num conversations plus a distinct scrollbar.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, rather than a nested-folder design for supporting multiple signal-identifiers within one signalapp installation, it would be ‘easier’ to have a tabbed interface where you would see a conversation-list of worknums when you are on the +1-111-111-1111 conversation-list-tab, and if you swiped the tab-bar (or hit an appropriate hotkey combo on signal4desktop) you would change to the +2-222-222-2222 conversation-list-tab with all your personal-num contacts.</p>\n<p>The most difficult thing about supporting multiple signal-identifiers in a single signalapp installation, is how to handle people in multiple areas, such as the coworker-who-is-also-a-friend example mentioned above.  Should all your chat-history with that human, be merged into a single chat?  Probably not, since when you call them from 1-111-111-1111 you are wanting to talk about a big client deadline, and when you call them from 2-222-222-2222 you are wanting to plan a picnic.</p>\n<p>But in other kinds of situations, you WOULD want to combine the chat-history… such as when your spouse sends you a note via your 2222 num, about family-stuff, but then later sends you a note via 1111 num which is also about family-stuff typically, it is easier if you can merge all those discussions into a single chat-history screen. (Maybe you would also wish to have a <strong>single</strong> conversation-list entry for your spouse as well, if you always <em>reply</em> via your 2222 num to their messages, regardless of which num <em>they</em> sent something to you via… though of course, this only works if you are merging all their messages into one place… which is in the “wrong tab/folder” in some sense!)</p>\n<p>Then there is the situation where your spouse is also your coworker, and things quickly get difficult because you usually want to MOVE your personal-life messages over to the personal-num folder/tab, and MOVE your work-life messages over to the work-num folder/tab… so maybe, when you tap on the ‘spouse-who-is-a-coworker’ entry, there should be folders and tabs on the chat-history page, not just on the conversation-list page, since the person in question falls into two categories?  Hard feature-design questions.</p>\n</details>\n<p>Which brings us back around to the samsung-dual-messenger discussion… there is  simplistic and more kludge-like way to implement multiple signal-identifiers within a single signalapp, which is basically to</p>\n<ul>\n<li>have a launcher-icon on the homescreen called the +1-111-111-1111 signalapp and</li>\n<li>a different launcher on the homescreen called the +2-222-222-2222 signalapp</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you open icon#1 you “login” to the signalapp APK as +11111111111 and communicate to signal-server via that identifier and open the SQLCipher associated with that pubkey.</p>\n<p>By contrast, when you tap on icon#2, you are “logged out” of your +11111111111 identifier, and then “logged in” to your +22222222222 identifier, which uses a different SQLCipher local database and a different signal-identifier but otherwise runs in the same APK.</p>\n<p>This is <em><strong>not</strong></em> simultaneous operation, you would not be able to cryptocall yourself, as is possible with SecureFolder.  You could asynchronously message yourself, possibly, but I’m not sure you would get the notifications unless a background-service periodically ‘logged in’ as whatever signal-num just received an incoming message.  But this is almost certainly how DualMessenger works, and would save space on the filesystem and a bit of battery-life.</p>\n<p>In the long run though, the best approach is to get proper multiple-simultaneous-signal-identifiers-all-at-once-within-one-APK, since that permits the most efficient use of the enduser’s brain/eyeballs as well as batterylife/cpu/network.  And more importantly, paves the way to allowing non-phone-num identifiers such as emails or nick-nums or long pubkey fingerprints or whatever.</p>",
