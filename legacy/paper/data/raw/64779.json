A joke for an application that was supposed to protect our data lol</p>\n<p>I opened Signal and received the same message, “Problem Retrieving Data.” I immediately continued with recovery but it got stuck at 56% for about 10 seconds, then continued to 72%, then the “Data Not Recovered” message came up. I figured all was lost so I went ahead and pressed “Rest Signal,” and the app just crashed, so I went to Settings &gt; General &gt; iPhone Storage &gt; Signal and it looked like all my data was still there</p>\n<p>Same problem on all version of signal since few months, no update fix it, why? Our data is not important ?

Signal had a problem while trying to open. Please send a debug log to support@signal.org to help troubleshoot this issue.** \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n- Open Signal App\n- Small Prompt in the bottom shows the message \"**Couldn't Open Signal**\"\n- Two options shown at this point: **Submit Debug Log** or **Open Signal Instead**\n- When I click on **Open Signal** instead app crashes and I return back to home screen\n- When I click on **submit debug log**, it creates the log and gives various options to share the log like: **Email Support, Copy Link, Open a Bug Report, Share and Cancel**\n- After clicking on either of these options in no case does the app open. It is only crashing and then we repeat the whole process again\n- **_I also tried to uninstall the app and install again. It was working then but after 5-6 hours the bug started to show up again._** \n\n\n**Actual result:** \nThe app does not open and crashes every time\n\n**Expected result:** \nThe app should open when I click on use signal app instead or after I close it. Not really sure why this is happening. \n\n### Screenshot\n![Signal App Launch Crash](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47687097/177286874-be3f41f5-29e8-4f9f-827f-897195f27f58.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n### Device info\n\n**Device**: iPhone 6\n\n**iOS version**: 12.5.5 (16H62)\n\n**Signal version:** 5.42.0.12\n\n### Link to debug log\nhttps://debuglogs.org/ios/5.42.0/1827923fba28c363a2d491730d8b11ef55524d521220bf4d98cfefdf3b85f94f.zip\n\n&lt;!--  If this is a crashing bug, after filing this issue, email a copy of your latest crash report to support@whispersystems.org\n\nTo get a crash log:\n\n1.
