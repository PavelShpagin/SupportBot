        "cooked": "<p>I have a question for the Signal community: how deeply do you think Google’s ecosystem is embedded within the Signal app, and do you believe this is a wise choice?</p>\n<p>Signal was initially (<em>at least I knew that way</em>) conceived as a project aiming to distance itself from major tech ecosystems, prioritizing privacy and independence. However, upon examining the codebase[1] (<em>and I’m not an expert, so it’s relatively easy to spot</em>), it appears that several Google-based services are utilized. For example, Firebase (<em>presumably, i hope, only for notifications</em>), payment mechanisms, mapping services, and potentially more.</p>\n<p>Perhaps I misunderstood Signal’s original mission, but I initially thought the consensus was to trade off certain conveniences or features in favor of crafting a truly independent, free-source software.</p>\n<p>This issue stems from a broader consideration regarding free software. As many of you are aware, Google has a reputation for being incompatible with the ideals of free software for reasons extensively explained by Richard Stallman[2].</p>\n<p>This raises two key questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To what extent can Signal truly be considered free software?</li>\n<li>Are these conveniences (<em>e.g., Firebase, payments, etc.</em>) genuinely necessary? Or would it be better to focus on a simpler messaging application that minimizes reliance on proprietary ecosystems?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I’d love to hear the community’s thoughts on these points.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-256954-links-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-256954-links-1\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Links:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Asignalapp%2FSignal-Android+%22com.google.android.gms%22&amp;type=code\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Code search results · GitHub</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.stallman.org/google.html\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Reasons not to use Google</a></li>\n</ol>",

That does not mean that Android is not. A large reality can have dozens of free children and dozens of nonfree children. Can Android be considered a free child? Fine, but that does not take away from the fact that Google does not meet many conditions of free software, and therefore a father cannot be considered free if he has a free child but only if the whole eco system is free. Behind a single nonfree library can hide any line of code and, therefore, no one guarantees that there are no backdoors. This concept is explained very well by Richard Stallman in his meetings.

And this is a good motivation to add new features completely based on google? If there is (I emphasize the conditional, <strong>if</strong> there is) this need I think it would be more appropriate to start figuring out whether that functionality really makes sense to put in. Reading these comments it does not sound like a nonprofit at all to me but rather like any other company that in order to reach more people adds things in such a way that “for some reason it lands on my app.”</p>\n<p>A payment method like the use of maps and more are features that are completely disconnected from the primitive sense of a secure messaging app and then at this point I would not be surprised by the profiling of users with artificial intelligence to improve their experience, but what are we talking about?</p>\n<p>Anyone who decides to abandon other huge company apps for Signal knows that they might lose a few things and knows that it is the lesser of two evils. I firmly believe that many people like me would be happy to have less functionality as long as they don’t have to resort to f-droid for the umpteenth time.</p>\n<p>To what extent will Signal say yes to the new features? Is there a limit or just because it has a good security protocol then that allows the development of anything?</p>\n<p>PS: I would like to point out that unfortunately by messages it can happen that tones are interpreted in the wrong way, I would like this to be considered a low-key discussion. &lt;3</p>",
