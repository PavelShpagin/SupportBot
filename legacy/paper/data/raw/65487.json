        "cooked": "<p>I was going to open a new thread but thought I would try and find one that is most aligned to what I was looking for. This one is exactly it!</p>\n<p>I like this idea for a number of reasons - mainly innovation and features.</p>\n<p>I have donated a fair amount of money to Signal since the donate feature first came out. However, I am seriously considering downgrading to the lowest denominator as I can’t see many significant changes or features being added recently.</p>\n<p>I think it’s important to support the Signal ambition and it would be great if more paid a fair, proportionate sum towards it. It’s my <em>only</em> method of communication and the thought of not paying something would bother me.</p>\n<p>But my issue is the lack of innovation and, I have to say, this forum (generally speaking) speaks volumes for why this might be the case. This is not personal (and that is not my intent), just an observation. I know the devs will be working hard and perhaps it’s the ‘under the hood’ stuff that the non-technically minded people (like myself) do not fully understand.</p>\n<p>But this thread created by <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/meonthew3\">@MeOnTheW3</a> seems very fair and perhaps an alternative/additional way of showing support for certain features. When I leave the supermarket, they give you little tokens you can drop into a selection of causes at a machine by the exit door. The supermarket will donate X amount to the cause depending on what people have ‘voted’ for with these tokens.</p>\n<p>Looking some <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/824506840\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">previous accounting years</a>, the Revenue:Expenses is very tight, also not helped by Assets:Liabilities. However, when you look at the salaries and expenses for those on the Board, I do have to wonder where these donations are going. As such, I would feel more comfortable with donations being used as an additional metric for support towards features much like the OP has outlined.<br>\nHow this would look requires much deeper consideration, but perhaps one way would be £5 donation gets you 5 votes, £10 gets you 10 votes and so on. To encourage higher donations, perhaps £100 gets you 200 votes or similar. Again, this is not definitive, just an idea in support of the OP’s original message which I think is a good idea and, as this is purportedly a community forum, hopefully garnering further innovative thinking and not immediate dismissals without sufficient explanation.</p>\n<p>Thank you <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/meonthew3\">@MeOnTheW3</a> for this idea!</p>",
