[…] This technique is sometimes called cascading, and can be extended far beyond only two algorithms and keys.</p>\n<p>Pessimists have said that there is no guarantee that the two algorithms will work together to increase security. There may be subtle interactions between the two algorithms that actually decrease security.</p>\n<p>Even triple encryption with three different algorithms may not be as secure as you think. Cryptography is a black art; if you don’t know what you are doing, you can easily get into trouble.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The problem is much more complex and there are ways to cascade ciphers but it cant be done just by slapping “sha256” or some “salt phrase” on top of existing crypto protocols. The best case, you just get less efficient crypto protocol, the worst case you could inadvertently break your existing encryption.</p>\n<p>And remember it’s not like Signal protocol is set in stone and doesn’t keep up with new threats.

        "cooked": "<p>I’d recommend reading up on the cryptography from <a href=\"https://signal.org/docs/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Signal’s documentation</a>. Signal already uses AES and SHA in various places. We cannot simply “add” a hashing algorithm or a salt phrase to “keep the conversation more secure”. That doesn’t make much sense. Implementing another layer of AES would be possible. You could actually do it yourself assuming you handle key exchanges too. Or if you wanted to pre-share a key with your friends that would work too. But why?</p>\n<p>Signal is already considered one of if the most secure messaging apps. The team has spent countless hours developing an extremely secure protocol. It’s already secure enough. To put it into perspective, your suggestion would be like going to the most secure military base in the world and suggesting they add “armed guards” to make it more secure. Sure, this might make it more secure, but if it’s already the most secure then it’s probably redundant and unnecessary.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you have to think of security as a chain, where any system is only as strong as the weakest link. If someone wants to compromise your Signal messages, it would likely be easier to exploit a vulnerability in one of the many other applications on your device, then just read the Signal messages once the attacker has local access.</p>\n<p>Moreover, if you want to apply your own layer of cryptography on top of the Signal protocol, you can. However, it wouldn’t make sense. It also wouldn’t be as easy as “adding sha256 or AES512” like you suggested. If you want to experiment for fun you can use a website like CyberChef along with the “AES Encrypt/Decrypt” functionality to send your friends messages. This could be a good way to experiment with what you want, however I wouldn’t do this with any messages you actually want to keep secure. You’re more likely to leak your keys/messages doing something like this.</p>\n<p>Overall, you’re more than safe just using the Signal app by itself. If you’re looking to stay even more secure I would recommend using secure operating systems, GrapheneOS for mobile, GNU/Linux based systems for desktop, etc. Your weakest link will not be Signal, so there’s no need to secure it further.</p>",

Signal is already secure, so there’s no need to worry about securing it further unless a weakness can be found and proven. Anyone is encouraged to look for weaknesses as it will help improve the platform for everyone. As I previously mentioned, users are much more likely to be compromised through a vulnerability in their operating system or another application they use.</p>",

    "excerpt": "<p>I’d recommend reading up on the cryptography from <a href=\"https://signal.org/docs/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Signal’s documentation</a>. Signal already uses AES and SHA in various places. We cannot simply “add” a hashing algorithm or a salt phrase to “keep the conversation more secure”. That doesn’t make much sense. Implementing another layer of AES would be possible. You could actually do it yourself assuming you handle key exchanges too. Or if you wanted to pre-share a key with your friends that would work too. But why?</p>\n<p>Signal is already considered one of if the most secure messaging apps. The team has spent countless hours developing an extremely secure protocol. It’s already secure enough. To put it into perspective, your suggestion would be like going to the most secure military base in the world and suggesting they add “armed guards” to make it more secure. Sure, this might make it more secure, but if it’s already the most secure then it’s probably redundant and unnecessary.</p>\n<p>Additionally, you have to think of security as a chain, where any system is only as strong as the weakest link. If someone wants to compromise your Signal messages, it would likely be easier to exploit a vulnerability in one of the many other applications on your device, then just read the Signal messages once the attacker has local access.</p>\n<p>Moreover, if you want to apply your own layer of cryptography on top of the Signal protocol, you can. However, it wouldn’t make sense. It also wouldn’t be as easy as “adding sha256 or AES512” like you suggested. If you want to experiment for fun you can use a website like CyberChef along with the “AES Encrypt/Decrypt” functionality to send your friends messages. This could be a good way to experiment with what you want, however I wouldn’t do this with any messages you actually want to keep secure. You’re more likely to leak your keys/messages doing something like this.</p>\n<p>Overall, you’re more than safe just using the Signal app by itself. If you’re looking to stay even more secure I would recommend using secure operating systems, GrapheneOS for mobile, GNU/Linux based systems for desktop, etc. Your weakest link will not be Signal, so there’s no need to secure it further.</p>"
