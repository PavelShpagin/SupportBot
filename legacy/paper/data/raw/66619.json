I called them with a normal call and asked what happened. Turns out both have kept their same devices and haven’t uninstalled/reinstalled the app, and their phone number is the same. Signal was asking them about verification “Are you human?” type of verification plus theybhad to introduce a verification code sent to their device via SMS. Why did this happen?</p>\n<p>Once they verified again their account they could message me again, because before they couldn’t.<br>\nWhat’s bad is that Signal created a new chat and the old one, with all the chat history is there, but says that the person doesn’t use Signal.</p>\n<p>Whatever is happening that causes this, either a bug or intentional, it is appalling, incredible bad, horrible, UX. People thought I was ignoring them and I thought they had decided to uninstall the app.<br>\nMind you, these people aren’t young and I we don’t talk frequently.</p>\n<p>This should be reviewed, seriously. One of the worst experiences I’ve had in an app. Literally thought people were angry/annoyed at me and vice-versa. I am now wondering if all those contacts that I have as “This person no longer uses Signal” is unintentional.</p>",

Signal requires this because they don’t have any kind of usage information or automatic bug reports that go to them, so the only way to get any information is to have someone submit logs for the developers to look at. Sure it’s not always convenient and may not be feasible for everyone, but that’s how it has to be if you want privacy. Even big name corporations with paid software will ask users for logs sometimes in certain situations.</p>",
