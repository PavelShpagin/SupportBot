From what I can tell from their docs and website, they want to create a Sauron-AI that can see everything you do: what you buy, what you post and view on social media, your messages (even when encrypted in e.g., WhatsApp), what you eat, where you go and travel, and much more. This creates a single point of failure for your entire online identity.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"Slartibartfast\" data-post=\"5\" data-topic=\"66935\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/s/ecae2f/48.png\" class=\"avatar\"> Slartibartfast:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>whether their claims of a 100% private AI were feasible/ credible</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>I think, even without insider knowledge, I can pretty confidently say: 100% privacy is not achievable. You would need 100% security first, which already is impossible. Every service that promises “100%” privacy/security/anonymity etc. is sus to me.</p>\n<p>Maybe you can elaborate on <em>what</em> of their features you want in Signal? An AI that has access to all your messages and answer questions about your past conversations? Even if Signal were able to create a secure on-device LLM (see Avitus’ post), what data does it have access to? Basically all my chats are set to auto delete messages (most in 4 weeks, others in even less time). The AI model would require people who want to use it to save their messages basically forever (or for as long as you use the AI) or it would be quite useless.</p>\n<p>I still don’t see a reason why you would want that in Signal. Signal is a messenger, not an assistant. If you want a full on assistant in there, Signal would need to have access to your bank accounts, social media, shopping accounts and integrate with a bunch of other services. That has nothing to do, in the least, with a messenger.<br>\n(Alternatively, you could invest in an Alfred or Niles, if you have the money. The former would probably be the most privacy respecting assistant you can get <img src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/images/emoji/apple/upside_down_face.png?v=12\" title=\":upside_down_face:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":upside_down_face:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">)</p>",
