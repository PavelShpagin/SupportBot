I typically do not want group overlap, and want to keep the group conversation going in the thread I already have. For me, the friction comes from having to go into profile of one of the group members, scroll to the “Groups in Common” section, and find the group that I know exists but is buried too deep in my chat history list. Then I pick that group and continue the existing conversation.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the current behavior is still different than new users would expect, resulting in unexpected and unwanted group duplication in many cases. I’ve had a friend tell me “Signal is dumb” because he kept getting new groups when all he wanted to do was text me and my wife by typing our names.</p>\n<p>In my original post I did ask about a toggle to let people choose the behavior. Maybe to your point, that toggle defaults to the current behavior, but users can opt-in to reusing existing groups in the case of full overlap.</p>\n<p>That would allow use cases like yours, while also allowing a more “expected” experience for people who are just coming onto Signal and not knowing or caring about its own unique nuances.</p>",

The button does what it says it will: creates a new group.  What I’m saying is also true: <em>many</em> of the users I’ve brought onto Signal struggle with the UI and don’t know how to find existing groups, or want it to be a quicker process to just type a couple of names into New Group and land inside the existing group with just those people.</p>\n<p>I am not saying that the existing workflow is wrong, nor that the other idea is right.  I’m talking about my actual experience with Signal, and proposing a toggle to change the behavior for people who might like it a different way.  In contrast, all of your responses are just telling me that I am wrong and refusing the possibility that other people might expect or prefer a different behavior.</p>",
