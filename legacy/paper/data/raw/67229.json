        "cooked": "<p>Hi. I would like to find out my best way of moving my Signal account to a new phone after the previous one has become unavailable, while preserving history and other details as much as possible.</p>\n<p>Here is the story:</p>\n<p>I started using Signal on Android phone A, which is still available but not in regular use anymore. Almost immediately, I installled signal-desktop on my Linux PC and linked it to my account. Phone A basically works but has always had issues, so some time (more than a year) ago I transferred the Signal installation to Android phone B, using the function in the app. This way I recreated all settings and history on phone B. I’ve never tried to start Signal on phone A since then. The installed version on phone A is 6.28.6.</p>\n<p>In summer 2024, phone B became unusable (water damage) and won’t boot anymore. My signal-desktop installation has been my only access to Signal since then.</p>\n<p>I now would like to start using Signal on my new Android phone C, which works and has my original phone number. I would like to preserve as much information as possible (such as history and security keys, if that is the right term). I definitely want to keep my signal-desktop installation active and want my history and groups/contacts preserved there.</p>\n<p>I could still start Signal on phone A and rerun the transfer function if that helps, but I do not have a working SIM card for phone A anymore (as phone C has a different SIM format).</p>\n<p>Ideally I would like to use Molly one phone C rather than the official Signal app, but if that has to be done in a separate step I’m willing to start by installing the official app.</p>\n<p>What is my best (or indeed only) way to proceed? Thanks for any advice you can give me.</p>",

It was a bit against my instinct to discard the work I’d just done to connect Molly to my account. But it seemed clear that this was what I’d have to, do so I went ahead and did it. And it turned out I didn’t have to do all the steps again (I didn’t have to receive another SMS message with a code). When I ran signalbackup-tools to merge the empty backup with the data from signal-desktop, there were many warnings and errors so I wasn’t sure how much history I would get to see in Molly. But then the end result turned out to be 1.5 GB in size so it became clear that the errors would be negligible. The end result is so much more restored history than I had expected before starting this thread.</p>\n<p>A slight caveat is that many or all groups are shown on top in Molly, including long-dormant ones, because the action of me joining these groups is shown as a new event. So all these groups have recent activity and are therefore shown on top of the chat list. Fortunately this rejoining event does not show up in signal-desktop so the sorting there is not distorted in this way. I guess I will just have to wait for new messages in other chats pushing these groups down the list in Molly, that’s okay.</p>\n<p>Again, thank you so much!</p>",

Set a Signal PIN on your Linux PC, then register phone C and use your Signal PIN to restore your contacts &amp; group memberships. You might need to relink your Linux PC after this, but you won’t lose anything on your PC during that process. Phone C will not have message history.</p>\n<p>If you want message history on phone C, you will need to do the above, create a backup from phone C, use <a href=\"https://github.com/bepaald/signalbackup-tools\">signalbackup-tools</a> to merge the empty phone C backup with the Linux PC database, delete your user data from phone C, then restore that merged backup onto phone C during the restore account process. You could also try this process using phone A (assuming you update it to the latest version), then make a full backup of phone A and transfer it to phone C or use the transfer function to move the history from phone A to phone C.</p>\n<p>For any of these processes you can leave the SIM in phone C and input the SMS that you receive there into whichever phone you are using. It also doesn’t matter if you use Molly or the official Signal client for this.</p>\n<p>edited to include the need to delete user data from the new phone.</p>"
