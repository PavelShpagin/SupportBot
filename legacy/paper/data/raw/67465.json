THE CONTRIBUTION REVENUE ARISING FROM THE IMPUTED INTEREST WAS NOT RECOGNIZED ON THE 2018 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FORM 990 (PREPARED ON A CASH BASIS), BUT RECOGNIZED ON THE 2019 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (PREPARED ON AN ACCRUAL BASIS) AS A CHANGE TO THE BEGINNING OF YEAR NET ASSETS. THE IMPUTED INTEREST CONTRIBUTION IS BEING EXCLUDED FROM SCHEDULE A, PART II, LINE 1 AS: (I) THE ORGANIZATION INTENDS ON PAYING THE ORGANIZATION BACK IN FULL, AND (II) THE AMOUNT RECORDED AS CONTRIBUTION REVENUE ARISING FROM IMPUTED INTEREST IS CALCULATED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE LOAN WILL BE REPAID IN FEBRUARY 2068, WHILE THE ORGANIZATION INTENDS ON REPAYING THIS LOAN SOME TIME BEFORE THIS DATE; THUS, THE AMOUNT IS NOT FIXED AND DETERMINABLE.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The 2019 filing reports the balance due to Brian Acton dropping from $105,000,400 to $29,651,678.<br>\nFor the past 4 years of filings the balance due to him has increased by 2.66% each year.<br>\nNotably, 2.66% interest until the 50 years are over, continued from balance due end of 2019 is $104,989,933.<br>\nNotice how the interest expense in part IX line 20 sometimes exactly matches the yearly increase in balance due to Brian Acton.</p>\n<p>It appears the Signal Foundation reclassified Brian Acton’s $105,000,400 loan at 0% interest for 50 years to a roughly $28,257,124 loan at 2.66% for the same period <strong>to boost their apparent net asset position</strong>.</p>\n<p>Where <a href=\"https://nelsonslog.wordpress.com/2023/12/08/signal-foundation-financials/\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Signal Foundation financials | Nelson's log</a> says Brian forgave the loan it is incorrect to assume so.</p>\n<p>However, every year there is a note along the lines of:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>THE ORGANIZATION OBTAINED A 0% INTEREST, UNSECURED PROMISSORY NOTE FROM BRIAN ACTON (PRESIDENT, SECRETARY, AND TREASURER OF THE ORGANIZATION) WHICH IS PAYABLE ON THE 50-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE DATE THE LOAN WAS ORIGINATED (FEBRUARY 28, 2018). FOR GAAP REPORTING PURPOSES, WHILE A PORTION OF THE LOAN HAS BEEN RE-CHARACTERIZED AS AN INHERENT CONTRIBUTION (AND THUS, THE LOAN ONLY REFLECTS AN END-OF-YEAR BOOK BALANCE OF $32,934,746 ON FORM 990, PART X, LINE 22 AND SCHEDULE L, PART II, COLUMN (F)), NONE OF THE $105,000,400 ORIGINAL LOAN FACE-VALUE HAS BEEN PAID-OFF AS OF 12/31/2023.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Inherent contribution implies Brian Acton forgave $75,348,722 of loan. But as previously mentioned the 2.66% interest would increase the amount due back to the original figure.</p>\n<p>Signal doesn’t clarify where their revenue is coming from. ‘Contributions and grants’ (All other contributions, gifts, grants, and similar amounts not included above), ‘Program service revenue’ (SERVICE REVENUE and LICENSING FEES) and ‘Other revenue’ (Royalties) are generic.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Why does Signal claim part of an interest-free loan has been forgiven to reduce its liabilities, maintain the rest is at 0% interest, when in fact Signal has effectively reclassified their loan as 2.66% interest that would ultimately sum to the same amount, all to temporarily boost their net asset position?</li>\n<li>Is ‘Contributions and grants’ entirely user donations or is a part of Brian Acton’s alleged loan forgiveness included in this figure? If so Brian’s loan would have been double-counted.</li>\n<li>How does Signal Messenger LLC relate to expenses and revenue of Signal Foundation?</li>\n<li>How much money is coming from MobileCoin and what is it classified as?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A full transparent report on all Signal’s finances would address these concerns rather than the generic terms and financial gymnastics presented in the IRS form 990 filings.</p>",

Signal only implemented a wallet for storage. MobileCoin the company was the sole handler of currency exchange. Since MobileCoin the company doesn’t exist anymore, and few if any code changes have been made to the wallet within Signal in ~years, it’s probably safe to assume Signal has no involvement with MobileCoin anymore. It’s unknown why the wallet is still present, but it’s opt-in so I often forget it’s there because I’ve never turned it on.</p>",
