The new safeguard warns users when they link a new device and checks with them again at a randomized interval a few hours after that device is added to confirm that they still want to share all messages with it. Signal now also requires a form of authentication such as entering a passcode or using FaceID or TouchID on iOS to add a new linked device.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, that’s a new article for me. Seemingly things are “good enough” now based on that reporting … I still think there’s some merit to making the interaction more well … interactive, but based on commentary so far I’m in the minority, so I’ll just mark this as resolved.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>is it now? [etc]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I do still disagree with this take, phishing is a major topic in “security circles.” It’s not about blame, it’s not about fully “solving it” (because it <em>is</em> always user error), it’s about making it harder.</p>\n<p>For some definition of “security circles” what you say surely true, but it’s also unhelpful. In a broader industry since, phishing is most definitely a consideration that needs taken seriously.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>the most popular messaging software on planet earth doesn’t do it. Discord doesn’t do it. i also think Telegram doesn’t do this, but i don’t use it so i can’t check. the majority it is not.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>IIRC I’ve seen Google software authentication (as a whole) and Google Messages (as a device pairing feature) all take this “match the code” approach. Apple Authentication, Android TV, Telegram also does do a device linking code (typically some 6-digit number).</p>\n<p>It’s a strategy that’s clearly getting use; so we can debate whether it’s <em>truly</em> a majority approach or not, but it’s a non-insignificant amount of software using such an approach.</p>",
