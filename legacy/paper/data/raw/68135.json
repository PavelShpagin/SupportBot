        "cooked": "<p>Edit: Bottom line - e2e encrypted photo storage done the Signal way - minimalist (separate?) paid service to keep Signal chat donation and free-to-use, and strategy to bring in more users, and their families. As Signal CEO recently said; to poorly paraphrase anyway; more people on the platform = more private.</p>\n<p>Firstly, to anyone reading this who has worked and is a part of Signal - <em>thank you from the bottom of my heart</em>.</p>\n<p>I wanted to share a feature or product idea, which could help fund Signal.</p>\n<p>I think there’s now enough awareness, or at least enough information becoming available to increase awareness of the big companies, and now even Apple as a non-solution to the surveillance-capitalism hyper-state. (Citing for example the recent $95M settlement re: Apple selling data collected via hey siri voice activation and selling this to third parties). People’s “private” and “secure” option is not as private as they thought. Plus, iCloud is slow, doesn’t sync properly, and a simpler better functioning service would be worth more to users.</p>\n<p>A photo and documents service with E2E encryption just like messages, would be something I believe to attract paying customers, and ideally this could help offset costs for the main Signal app. Essentially a storage and retrieval service like Dropbox, but as minimal and elegant for this purpose as Signal is for communication. This would also allow people to exchange through Signal larger files leveraging their encrypted cloud storage service. As a consultant of 20+ years who has worked with many businesses in most segments, this would be highly desireable for sensitive storage and sharing needs also.</p>\n<p>I’m sure it’s not a new idea, but I figure it’s worth sharing.</p>\n<p>Thanks :)</p>",

        "cooked": "<p>Hi, thanks for your reply. I’m not so much looking for an office suite, the topic was changed. I’m proposing a very minimalist end to end encrypted photo service which could help subsidise Signal, and help bring in any users who think Messages is “good enough” - something to help achieve the goals discussed in the recent SXSW talk. People use Messages and social media to share photos, and photos are just as sensitive as messages for individuals, and a treasure trove of privacy info. I may have waxed lyrical too much in my previous post but the main point is; e2e encrypted photo storage done the Signal way - separate paid service to keep Signal chat donation and free-to-use, and strategy to bring in more users, and their families.</p>\n<p>As a side note, I have attempted to bring my entire network on board, and for the most part, it enables nearly everything people want to be able to do, and those who were quiet on social media, now share photos daily. The ability to have all photos encrypted with Signal would mean millions could cancel iCloud memberships.</p>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://community.signalusers.org/uploads/db3609/original/3X/1/7/17d5a7ab31f50bb0a92a2cddc0f7c53aae763289.png\" data-download-href=\"https://community.signalusers.org/uploads/db3609/17d5a7ab31f50bb0a92a2cddc0f7c53aae763289\" title=\"Screenshot 2025-04-01 at 12.42.52 AM\"><img src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/uploads/db3609/optimized/3X/1/7/17d5a7ab31f50bb0a92a2cddc0f7c53aae763289_2_139x500.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-04-01 at 12.42.52 AM\" data-base62-sha1=\"3oQJB4Ttj0NT7JFz84uIAsM4SKJ\" width=\"139\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://community.signalusers.org/uploads/db3609/optimized/3X/1/7/17d5a7ab31f50bb0a92a2cddc0f7c53aae763289_2_139x500.png, https://community.signalusers.org/uploads/db3609/original/3X/1/7/17d5a7ab31f50bb0a92a2cddc0f7c53aae763289.png 1.5x, https://community.signalusers.org/uploads/db3609/original/3X/1/7/17d5a7ab31f50bb0a92a2cddc0f7c53aae763289.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"434338\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">Screenshot 2025-04-01 at 12.42.52 AM</span><span class=\"informations\">172×616 21.2 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>",

In my opinion, if the Signal team did want to fork off and start creating new major features like this, they should at least wait until the app has some more major features and reaches feature parity with other messaging apps. For example, live location sharing is a big one, things like group chat polls, screen sharing improvements (improved quality, allow multiple screen shares at once, allow screen sharing and camera), etc, etc.</p>\n<p>Signal is just trying to do one thing really well, messaging. It would be cool to see other projects come out of the Signal foundation/Signal team if possible. However, I don’t see that happening any time soon at least.</p>\n<p>I think what you’re looking for is more similar to Proton, Tuta, or something similar. Also, if you really want to keep your images on the Signal app, you can always send yourself images in the “Note to self” option which will sync to all your devices. It’s not stored in the “cloud” per-say(at least not permanently), but it will be locally accessible by all your devices which is honestly preferred in my opinion. I’d prefer to not have all my images stored on some random server indefinitely.</p>",
