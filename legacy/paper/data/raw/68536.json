        "cooked": "<p>I rarely use my smartphone for anything, most of the time Wifi and cellular are turned off and I basically only use it for direct phone calls. The vast majority of my usage of Signal is on the Desktop app, which I might be using for months without opening the Signal app on my smartphone. In fact, I think last year I didn’t open it at all, not even once. Yet despite this I never got this “Open Signal on your phone to keep your account active. Learn more” message that shows up on Signal Desktop, which now appears quiet frequently. While it’s not a big deal it seems to be annoying since opening up the Signal app again on my phone takes quiet some time to sync everything and it’s just an annoyance in general.</p>\n<p>I wanted to know though which recent change or commit was made that would lead to this increased frequency on Signal Desktop? And is this something permanent or temporary? I hope it’s the latter.</p>",
