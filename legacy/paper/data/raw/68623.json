I’ve had a look but it is very ‘<em>way over my head</em>’. Does anyone know if there is a simplified version of this or whether some AI can go through and summarise what is going on (in layman’s terms) for each section of the Signal GitHub area?</p>\n<p>Failing that, what is a “Code Review”, a “Commit” and a “Pull”? I presume “Commit” is a committal to something? Does this mean that whatever is in “Commit” has gone to be released into the app for that OS?</p>\n<p>I have iOS, but I’m struggling to see what is going on currently. I’m aware there is no ‘Roadmap’ as such, but I would’ve thought this GitHub would at least show what is currently being looked at?</p>\n<p>Sorry if I’ve misunderstood if GitHub isn’t actually for this sort of query. Happy to stand corrected/pointed in the right direction.</p>\n<p>Thanks all.</p>",

        "cooked": "<p>Yes, GitHub can be overwhelming when you’re just getting started. I’m not a professional either, but maybe this summary could help: (some of it might have already been in the wiki)</p>\n<p>A <strong>repository</strong> (=repo) is basically one project owned by someone, i.e. there exists the official signal repository, belonging to signal and if someone wants to grab the code for themselves to edit it or add things they <strong>clone</strong> it into a repository of their own.</p>\n<p>A <strong>push</strong> is taking the content of a repo (with changes made) and sending it into another repo. If you push something, this results in a <strong>commit</strong> in the repo you pushed to.</p>\n<p>All <strong>commits</strong> in a repo show you its history, you can see, who added/removed/changed what and when. So, yes, the commits currently being made to the official repo show what the devs have recently added. However, not every commit has an effect on the official release (or any relese for that matter), this depends on whether that piece of code is being incorporated when building the app and, if so, whether it is being called by the app when it is running. For example, there is a lot of cloud backup code already in the android repo (including the menu interface to configure them in the app, not sure if it is also in the iOS repo), but it’s only being incorporated in the nightly releases (you need to build yourself) and not the ones you would get in the app store.</p>\n<p>A <strong>pull</strong> is taking the content of a repo and putting it into another repo. This also results in a commit in the repo you pull to. <strong>Cloning</strong> is the most “radical” form of pulling, where the result is identical to the repo it came from. If two repos are almost the same with one having something extra, these changes can be pulled and <strong>merged</strong> into the repo that is behind. This results in a repo combining content of both repos.</p>\n<p>This means, if I want to take the changes made to my repo on GitHub and include them into my local repo, I pull them and merge. If I want to take changes made locally to my repo and put them in the version on GitHub, I would push them. I can pull from any repo I own and any public repo, but I can only push to a repo I own.</p>\n<p>A <strong>pull request</strong> is a request to the owner of a repo, saying \"Hey, I have something to put in your repo, do you want it?'. So, if I want to ask the official signal repo to implement a feature I wrote the code for in my own repo, I open a pull request about this and the devs decide to either pull my code into their repo (resulting in a commit) or not. This is necessary because I can not push it myself, since I’m not a dev and I don’t own the official repo. :)</p>\n<p>A <strong>code review</strong> is exactly what it sounds like: Someone looks at code and decides if it is “good” by some given criteria.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, looking at commits is good for seeing what big things are gradually being worked on and what things have been added/removed/changed. It cannot show you what the devs are discussing internally and whether they are developing a feature or not, until they begin adding pieces of it to the official repo. It can also not give you a timeline of when stuff will be implemented. This info you can only get from official announcements or small hints here on the forum. (or if you personally know or are a dev)</p>",
