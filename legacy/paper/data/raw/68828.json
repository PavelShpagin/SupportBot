This would be nice, in case they need to call me (with no internet connection) so I can see if they are even able to do so.</p>\n<p>Especially with Signal users it’s also pretty likely that some of the account associated phone numbers aren’t even reachable with phone calls because they are used only for this account. So if you see that someone has your number, you can tell them not to even try calling.  :) This is especially an issue for chats started before usernames were a thing (and we might not all know which chats these are), because these people probably have your number and might not be able to use it for other stuff, so it would be cool to know which people to warn.</p>",
