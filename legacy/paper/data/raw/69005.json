        "cooked": "<p>This is a bit of a two parter.</p>\n<p>(Obligatory: I’ve searched extensively about this issue, and none of the things I found answered my questions.)</p>\n<p>FIRST AND FOREMOST:</p>\n<p>I recently transferred a Signal account from Android to Android.<br>\nNo error alert was displayed, and everything seems to be normal, but I want some way to verify that no messages are missing-- especially given the nature of signal backups.</p>\n<p>(I’m new to signal, so I didn’t know local backups were an option. I should have done that before transferring, and think it’d be great if Signal made that backup option more visible and suggested, as so many new user troubles come from backup issues.)</p>\n<p>A message counter feature would help tremendously with this, but it seems we don’t have that?</p>\n<p>Are there any other ways to verify the integrity of my transfer?</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>SECOND:</p>\n<p>The background connection seems to still be open.</p>\n<p>I haven’t uninstalled the signal app on my old phone yet, fearing that it holds the only full and uncompromised chat history, wondering if I can back it up somehow despite being no longer associated.</p>\n<p>At the same time, my signal desktop was unlinked. I’m devastated, as that could have been another potential backup. I had held on to it, hoping to find a way to extract a message history backup from it, but then I misclicked on relink, and it brought me to the QR code. Did I just wipe my signal desktop history?</p>\n<p>…</p>\n<p>From this, I have a few questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>What exactly does leaving this background connection do? Could it lead to data loss or leaks? Again, I’d been leaving the app installed in fear of losing a potential backup, and now I’m wondering it I should delete it…but I’d like to know what exactly the background connection does in this case to know what I stand to lose in either scenario.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Did I just wipe my signal desktop history? Are there any ways to get it back?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What are ways to verify message history integrity after the account has been transfered?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Finally, I know that all this panic could have been avoided by making backups before a transfer occured. (I think it’d be great if Signal prompted users to do so before transferring-- such prompts, as opposed to important features being relatively buried, would help streamline user experience a lot!)<br>\nBut for now, I’m just looking for solutions now that things have happened the way they have.</p>",

So I think it’s the same background connection that allowed the transfer, still there in some diminished form. This notification now only remains on the new phone.<br>\nI’m curious as to the consequences of having this background connection still there. What does it even do, now that the transfer is finished? Is it possible to close it without uninstalling signal on my old phone? Would it be advisable?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sweet! I’ll try this.

I’ve done some chats since my new device was registered, though, so the numbers don’t match up anyway… .<br>\n3a. But the search terms are truly a great idea! I was able to verify that a lot of the stuff that mattered was probably fine.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As for taking a local backup from my old phone, the ‘chats’ section is greyed out there. So maybe not.
