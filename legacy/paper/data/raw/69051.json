I found some awesome chats and people this way but I’ve also been terrified with what I’ve found.<br>\nSome issues I’ve noticed:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Raids</strong> : Malicious users can join public group chats and send CSAM, up until they are removed (moderation nightmare!!)</li>\n<li><strong>CSAM focused group chats</strong>. I’ve seen PBs of CSAM sent on signal now, I’ve even reported it directly to signal security email. I have seen at least 50k unique users in these group chats. I don’t expect signal to monitor public group chats, but since spam reports are accepted, I do expect signal to accept CSAM reports. It might be a bad idea to ban every user though, I’m not really sure what strategy should be taken to decide on who to ban. Maybe banning every one of them isn’t a bad idea. <strong>Comment your suggestions?</strong></li>\n<li><strong>CSAM sticker packs</strong>, self explanatory</li>\n<li><strong>CSAM profile pictures</strong>, self explanatory</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I won’t link any CSAM group chats here, but if signal staff are interested in some examples, search for my email \" CSAM reporting on signal\" sent to <a href=\"mailto:security@signal.org\">security@signal.org</a> , I can send a ton more examples (seriously at least 800 group chats, ranging from 100-1000 users)<br>\nI think making this issue public is the only way to give feedback to signal and influence signal since they ignored my email… <strong>Please like and share if you are interested in seeing this fixed.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Signal, please add a report CSAM button</strong><br>\nAnd maybe make it include media / recently sent messages from the user (like whatsapp), and maybe the user’s profile data<br>\nAt least so you can delete group chats and ban users? So you don’t host TBs on TBs of CSAM? You already ban spam?</p>",

This way, it is clearly visible to everyone when this happens too often and members can decide to open a new group with a different admin if they believe that there is censorship going on.</p>\n<p>I think having such a CSAM report button would be great, but I don’t think the implementation is possible within the signal framework. In contrast to users sending normal spam messages (which can be reported) there is no way to recognize CSAM by frequency of messages alone. To do this, viewing message content is necessary, which signal can not do currently and also most likely will never implement because it goes against the fundamental principles of signal. Even if this were implemented, it is also unclear what the consequences should be for users distributing CSAM.</p>\n<p>Since possession of a signal account is purely based on possession of a phone number, banning that number is not really a good solution, since in this case any other person receiving ownership of this number in the future would also be banned. Plus, these people could just use a new number, since if they are smart they aren’t using their primary number anyway or at least don’t have visibility turned on. Depending on the country and provider, it is very common for a number to go to a new owner quickly and therefore the risk would be high for random people being banned.</p>\n<p>Deleting the corresponding account could be an option, but it’s very easy to just set it up again and since these groups are public, getting back in would be very easy. The same goes for deleting a group with a lot of CSAM in it. It can easily be reestablished. There is also a risk that signal would delete groups with a hundred harmless people and one person hijacking this group with CSAM that hasn’t been removed quickly enough.</p>\n<p>Generally, it would be great if there was a good solution, but unfortunately I think this will not be happening/possible anytime soon.</p>",

I dont advocate for accepting or enabling nazi or terrorism or vulgarity or threats of violence reports, soley CSAM.<br>\nI understand the fear of compromising Signal’s mission. I believe Signal is responsible for platforming csam, not acknowledging this is practically condoning it. This is a moral imperative.<br>\nI’m fine if signal doesn’t moderate it, maybe banning users is out of the question, maybe making a list of users who post CSAM is out of the question. Much like on simplex, users should be able to notify servers that are platforming CSAM that they are platforming CSAM. It should be as easy as clicking a button to forward a report to NCMEC. I don’t believe there are any legal requirements/laws for a platform who accepts CSAM reports to also accept other kinds of extreme reports (terrorism, threats of violence). Signal is already required to follow the laws of where it is hosted. The risk of legislation has always been present. This does not increase that risk beyond it’s current state.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"TeeJay82\" data-post=\"11\" data-topic=\"69051\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/user_avatar/community.signalusers.org/teejay82/48/1806_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> TeeJay82:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The whole point of Signal is knowing next to nothing about their users so that they can’t be coerced into cooperation with law enforcement</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>This is a very narrow exception<br>\nSignal wouldnt be forced to cooperate with law enforcement any more than they are currently, which I believe they are forced to cooperate with law enforcement on extreme crimes already, though of course signal has very little metadata it can provide them. CSAM reporting can maintain this minimal data sharing. CSAM is univerally condemned, unlikely to be co-opted to compare to “crimes”. Signal could publicly commit to removing this reporting system if any attempts to co-opt into broader moderation it are made. Signal could publicly commit to exit markets where these demands are made (eg. EU demanding client side automatic CSAM scanning, I hope Signal would already exit that market if pressured to implement, only relying on user initiated reporting). Again, CSAM is universally condemned, Signal already has limited data sharing, CSAM reporting can maintain this. But, the whole point of CSAM reporting would be to compromise the privacy of the CSAM poster.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"TeeJay82\" data-post=\"11\" data-topic=\"69051\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/user_avatar/community.signalusers.org/teejay82/48/1806_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> TeeJay82:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Unfortunately this protects criminals as well as people living in oppressive regimes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>Sorry I don’t understand this either, how does protecting child predators protect oppressed minorities living in oppressive regimes? This is specifically about child predators.<br>\nI could see this if there are any laws that require platforms who accept CSAM reports to also accept “hate crime” /etc reports, im unaware of any such laws, but if they existed I assume they would apply to all platforms, and signal would already be banned in such regimes. I believe the risk of legislation would not be any greater than it is currently.<br>\nI believe signal is already cooperating with law enforcement to its fullest extent possible, yes signal collects minimal metadata, I don’t see how accepting CSAM reports would enable collection beyond what is currently possible, except data narrowly relevant to users posting CSAM. Signal’s cooperation is minimal by design, CSAM reporting can preserve this. Signal is already publicly commited to resisting censorship and moderation demands. CSAM reports could be anonymized to the maximum extent possible, and/or signal could refuse to log data, and/or forward reports without storage, and/or report data could be encrypted with a key that only NCMEC can use. External pressures are a risk but a carefully designed system can minimize the risks. This could only make it an easier UX to combat CSAM, rather than having to manually visit some other website/app/tool to report CSAM.</p>\n<p>I believe the moral imperative of CSAM reporting justifies implementing rigorous safeguards to protect minorities.<br>\nFailure to implement a CSAM reporting system only makes signal a haven for CSAM, maybe even better than tor.</p>",

Now Signal can respond to all data request “We do not gather any user data and have nothing to give you. Period.” Add CSAM reporting and they’ll say “Well, you make exception for CSAM so why not for X?”, and any pressure for logging, reporting and “benevolent” access for law enforcement (aka backdoors) will increase hundredfold.</p>\n<p>The first step is always the hardest. Let one exception exist and the next thing you know, you’ll be policing also terrorism, drugs, arms trafficking,money laundering, racism, sexism, illegal abortions and political jokes unapproved by government.</p>\n<p>You can have security for everyone, including very small percentage of bad people or you can start having exceptions and very soon you won’t have security for anyone.</p>",
