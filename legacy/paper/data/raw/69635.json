        "cooked": "<p>Signal has many important options that increase its security and privacy, and which allow users follow best practices. But not everybody uses these options, and best practices (such as for deleting groups) can sometimes involve complicated algorithms that users must implement manually.</p>\n<p>The internet is currently filling up with instructions about which options people can turn on to make their chats safer. Our group chats are often taken up by instructions for how to best protect each other. And the process of fully closing groups has become especially cumbersome - we have been taught to change the title of the group to things like “DELETE THIS GROUP” before removing everybody, and then hoping that people comply. And if we do things out of order, we are screwed.</p>\n<p>I propose to make these things easier by letting group admins set a “top secret” option. When set, all of signal’s extra protections against data leaks - such as prohibiting screenshots, not showing any content or metadata in notifications, not being included in backups - are enforced for all of that chat’s content, even if members have more permissive default options for their other chats.</p>\n<p>In a top secret chat, the disappearing messages timer can still be changed, but it’s impossible to turn it off.</p>\n<p>In a top secret chat, at any time the admin has the power to nuke it, which means: automatically remove all members, and automatically DELETE THE CHAT FROM ALL DEVICES. not just the messages, but the metadata, description, join/part/rename scrollback, everything. users can be warned of this possibility before they join a top secret chat. perhaps the UI could also show a notification to explain that a chat has been deleted, or even a parting message from the admin.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the chat could even be self-destructing, ie everybody is warned in advance, that the nuking will happen automatically at a scheduled time.</p>",

        "cooked": "<p>I feel like the not showing notifications should be a separate setting. This seems a little redundant though because you can already disable notifications for the entire app and some operating systems will allow you to disable reading notifications without authenticating first.</p>\n<p>Prohibiting screenshots won’t really work, I do see where people are coming from with this request though. This would at the very least prevent people on the default client from saving stuff without warning you at least, but it could be easily bypassed by someone with a custom app or another device as people have already pointed out. There are definitely times though where I wish I could have this feature to be more certain people aren’t screenshotting or saving something I posted, but whenever I’m uncertain if I can trust the people I usually just don’t send whatever I wanted to send. That’s usually the best practice. I could definitely see this feature being useful though, even if it is trivial to bypass, many people are not going to know how to do it right away.</p>\n<p>I don’t understand the whole nuking group or self deleting group or whatever. Surely what you want to hide in the group is the messages, right? How would deleting the group benefit you any more than just deleting the messages? I am genuinely curious about this use-case.</p>",

Basically, people download from the Play Market and App Store. But I will repeat the question again: are there really no effective ways to fight third-party clients so that they cannot connect to the server? Even if there are no such methods now - it does not mean that they will never be. But you could add this functionality in advance, which will increase privacy in Signal where it is needed.</p>",

Apparently, I missed this clarification when I wrote this text through a translator… Yes, it was precisely subjective statistics, based on life, where from school to university, only a tiny percentage of people had multiple devices. Even among my friends (and there are more than 20 of them), only one has a second smartphone, and that is for work and is always in his car. You can also ask people on the street how many smartphones they use at a time. I don’t know if it is customary in your culture to ask strangers this or not, but if it is, you can ask. You can ask your friends. Very few people use multiple smartphones at a time in their pockets. I don’t think it’s worth not implementing a useful feature because of this.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Because if a security feature is broken 7 out of 100 times its broken. There is no half security or 93% security. If you can break it it’s broken.<br>\nLook at Snapchat for an example.

And that’s very bad.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But this won’t break all of Signal’s security. It will just make a certain feature no longer effective between certain people. This won’t affect the security of Signal itself or all of its users…</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Not really. And especially not without locking out a lot of clients that are useful for a lot of people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it turns out that you specifically allow the existence of third-party clients? Why? Why can’t you provide the necessary functionality in the official client and block others? Let’s say the functionality I’m talking about is really useful and increases privacy, given that not everyone carries two smartphones in their pockets, and plus if you block third-party clients, adding useful and necessary functionality to the official client.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Have you read the discussion about the deletion timeframe? I don’t think this is a good idea.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But we are talking about a secret chat, where two interlocutors themselves decide after what time messages will be deleted. From one minute to 7 days after reading. That is, they can choose 3 days if they want.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Again: If security is broken in 1 out of 100 times, it’s broken. Regardless of the people that can’t break it. Would you trust encryption that is 99% safe? I don’t think so.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Let me repeat my message: this is not about breaking encryption or security in general. If someone has a third-party client or a second smartphone, the security of Signal itself will not be affected, but a certain feature will cease to be effective between certain people. That’s all. You already have a feature for sending a one-time photo in a chat. Why did you add it? Is this also security theater? Then this feature also makes no sense if there is a custom client or a second smartphone. You even banned screenshots of one-time photos on Android. You are great! But now I ask you to develop this functionality even further…</p>",
