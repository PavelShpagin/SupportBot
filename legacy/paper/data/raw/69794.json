For example, social media apps could be created that allow Signal users to have a social media like experience without needing to trust the social media service to implement an equivalent of the Signal protocol from scratch. Data would be sent first from User A’s social media app to the signal app via a app to app API, then to the signal servers, down to User B’s signal app, then to User B’s social media app (and vice versa).</p>\n<p>Signal already has implemented the stories feature which mimicks social media apps, but as a whole Signal is greatly lacking. Providing such an API would allow Signal to potentially facilitate large growth in the decentralized apps space, while simultaneously removing the burden from signal to implement the features of those apps in order to do so. This would benefit the app developers (many of whom I imagine would be fellow members of the open source community) for at least 3 key reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Users can trust the app’s encryption as it is based on the trust they have in the Signal App, making them more likely to try the developer’s app (especially if the app is open source)</li>\n<li>Developers (especially financially constrained independent developers like me) do not have the capacity or the knowledge to implement a Signal style protocol anyways.</li>\n<li>Depending on Signals wishes, developers may not have to provide their own servers. Perhaps the user and/or the developer could pay a nominal fee to Signal for these services. However it would be really cool if the user and/or developer could choose their own servers on a per-app basis, which would have it’s own benefits in terms of control.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I think this has the potential to greatly diversify the decentralized app market and DRAMATICALLY reduce the barrier to entry for building these kinds of apps. Please Signal &lt;3</p>",
