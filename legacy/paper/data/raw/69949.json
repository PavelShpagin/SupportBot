        "cooked": "<p>Hi everyone! Maybe it seems a rubbish thing but for me it’s a serious stuffs.</p>\n<p>yesterday around afternoon i got a call from a friend while he went to a swimming pool with his family. What he said got me confusing at first but when he mentioned every thing our friends start to fear to use the signal app.</p>\n<p>here’s what happened: While having a good time with his family he recieved the call from the nearby police station or we can say the Main branch of the police Station in our City. They didn’t tell me why but called him to come to the police station with phone(complusory). He didn’t know what happened but we went because he didn’t do anything wrong. When he arrived, the police officer mentioned “Who gave you the permission to use the Signal? Do you have contacts with some terr*****? or you are a drug dealers?” and many thing which was confusing for him because we only uses Signal because of the friend group we had to share our stuffs. (You know boys stuffs).</p>\n<p>Except the Group there was a User in his signal chat who is our friend too he turned off the number visibility for everyone and only his username was visible but what happened after taking the Username of the user police directly called him which is only possible when the Signal shares the Data with the Government or there affiliates which i believe is against the Policy of Signal and also not to mentioned the Person didn’t disclose the name of the user in his chat infront of thr Police as he said it’s his private thing weather the user is Girl or Boy Police don’t have to know that.</p>\n<p>But shockingly they took the username and after like 10 minutes he also came to the Police station because they called him but how???</p>\n<p>Is Signal Really safe? Is it just a Joke what Signal mentions Privacy???</p>\n<p>This is real stuffs and other folks are getting called to the Police station and Police are deleting there account and banning them to use the Signal again.</p>\n<p>Because of the Signal found in my friends phone Police also forcefully installed a Spyware in my friends phone and told him not to delete the App or try to FOrmat the phone. What the hell is this??? Signal I need answer.</p>",
