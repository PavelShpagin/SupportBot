Or, if there is some technical reason why the setting can not be dynamic, then it would still be favorable to have the ability to designate a device permanently as a non-messaging device.</p>\n<p>The use case is simple: at this time Signal requires the primary device be the smartphone used to register the account.  Some users actually have no intention of using Signal on a smartphone in any messaging capacity, rather they are using the smartphone as a management interface to their Signal account, since the Desktop app can not perform in that function at this time.  Requiring that the primary device receive messages when the user actually has no use for it has security and usability drawbacks:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The undelivered messages will queue up on Signal’s servers for days, weeks, months perhaps.  But there is no actual need for these messages to continue residing on Signal’s servers since the user does not want or expect their delivery.  The user will accumulate risk probably without even realizing a discreet remote archive of their chat history is building (albeit encrypted).</li>\n<li>The primary device Signal app will be practically unusable for hours upon using it for the first time in months, as the app will proceed to download and decrypt perhaps thousands of messages that have accumulated in that time.  Since the user does not actually want these messages, rather is just trying to perform routine Signal account maintenance, this disruption in usability to the app is without any benefit to the user, and it disrupts the user from performing what may be time sensitive account administration.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So, as long as it is a requirement of Signal that the primary device be immutably fixed to a smartphone, and as long as only the primary device has the capability to perform critical Signal account maintenance, the user should have the option to designate the primary device as a non-messaging device, to prevent the needless accumulation of messages on Signal’s servers, and to enhance the smartphone app’s usability in the simple case that it is only used for account administration.</p>",
