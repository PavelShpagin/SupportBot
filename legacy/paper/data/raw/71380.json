        "cooked": "<p>Hello everybody,<br>\nI am trying to understand various implications of moving from iOS to GrapheneOS.</p>\n<p>Basically, my current situation is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Main Signal app registered with my number on an old iPhone 11 Pro Max (not used anymore, I turn it on from time to time just to avoid getting the account deactivated)</li>\n<li>Molly on GrapheneOS on a Pixel 9 Pro XL (my daily driver for the past 9 months) as a linked device</li>\n<li>Signal Desktop on my PC as a linked device (this client has the oldest history, back to 2019)</li>\n<li>Signal on an iPad Pro as a linked device</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Why am I in this situation? Because I truly needed a new phone, and wanted to switch to GrapheneOS, but Signal at the time did not offer any way to move messages from iOS, so I figured I would just keep the main app on the iPhone and wait for backups to be implemented.</p>\n<p>After chat recovery for linked device, and now backups in the making, I want to understand the implications of actually deregistering the current main app from the iPhone, register my number on a fresh Signal install on GrapheneOS, and stop using Molly as a linked device,</p>\n<p>My main doubt is: what happens to linked devices? and especially to their history? I don’t want to lose the history on my desktop, and with coming backups I would like to restore it on all the other clients, is this going to be possible? like make a backup on the desktop client and restore it on the main app on your smartphone?</p>\n<p>But my problem is deeper, meaning that even if that was possible, I would need to first move Signal from iPhone to GrapheneOS first, and then attempt to restore from a linked device, but at that point I am not really sure the fresh install on GrapheneOS would be linked to any device.</p>\n<p>So I don’t know what to expect really, and I would like to understand what are my possibilities.<br>\nMy goal is to move the main Signal app from the old iPhone to the new Pixel and finally decouple Signal from the iPhone, plus restore my Signal desktop history to the (new) main Signal app on GrapheneOS.</p>\n<p>Is this feasible? Can I already make the move and possibly restore a linked device history on my main later on? it’s not really clear what happens when you register your number on a new device to linked devices and their histories, especially with coming backups.</p>\n<p>thanks for any help :)</p>",
