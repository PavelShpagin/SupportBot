This message is encrypted and has a timestamp of when it was sent.</p>\n<p>The server then recieves this message and all devices that are supposed to receive it can grab it from there, while the server keeps it long enough to do this, even if some people currently aren’t online.</p>\n<p>Usually, a device that is already registered to your account and temporarily is not connected to the servers will recieve all missed messages as soon as it reconnects. The same goes for other recipients’ primary and linked devices.</p>\n<p>However, the server only keeps the messages for a specified amount of time (I believe maybe 45 days, but please correct me if I’m wrong). This time is counted from the moment the message arrives to the server. After this time has run out, the message is deleted from the server, regardless of whether it has been recieved by everyone or not.</p>\n<p>After a recipient device pulls a message from the server, it decrypts it with is internal key and on the inside there might be a disappearing timer. If this timer has already run out, the message is then deleted from the device.</p>\n<p>It is absolutely possible to adapt the signal application on the recipient device to not do this, keep all messages and ignore the timer. It is however not possible to manipulate a device to pull messages older than 45 days (or whatever the server limit might be) because they are simply no longer on the server.</p>\n<p>The timer feature can <em>not</em> protect against a compromised device or application.</p>\n<p>When you do a device transfer, the older messages are transferred directly from one device to the other, because they no longer exist on the server. In this case any messages that has already been deleted from the first device (whether by tinder or manually), can not reappear on the new device, because they are no longer available anywhere. Messages with active timers of less than some limit (I think 24 hours) are also not transferred, but this can again be circumvented with adapted applications on the devices.</p>",

My previous statement applies to devices that were already connected at the time the message was sent. These devices would be able to decrypt the message (and then ignore the timer if they were modified in that way). The message would only be sent to the server encrypted for all devices that are currently linked, new ones couldn’t later decrypt them, even if they acquired it, because it  can’t be decrypted with their key.</p>\n<p>Also note that a modification to ignore timers doesn’t have to be malicious. Maybe someone wants to preserve a group chat, that has a disappearing timer set, for personal reasons, that doesn’t mean they’re going to use it against the senders.</p>",
