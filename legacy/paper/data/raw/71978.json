Usernames were first <a href=\"https://community.signalusers.org/t/usernames-in-signal/9157/624\">projected to be released in early 2023</a> - their actual release <a href=\"https://signal.org/blog/phone-number-privacy-usernames/\">was in February 2024</a>. looking at other projects, the COSMIC desktop environment was projected to have t<a href=\"https://blog.system76.com/post/cosmic-more-alpha-more-fun\">wo alphas before the beta release</a> - they ended up having <a href=\"https://blog.system76.com/post/cosmic-alpha-7-never-been-beta\">seven</a>.<br>\npromising a timeline is a good way to get people disappointed, or to rush stuff out before it’s ready.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-276493-h-5-theres-never-gonna-be-a-less-secure-version-of-signal-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-276493-h-5-theres-never-gonna-be-a-less-secure-version-of-signal-5\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>5. there’s never gonna be a less secure version of Signal.</h1>\n<p>call it what you want, be it the “light version”, the “normie” version, whatever, it’s not going to exist. there’s not gonna be a “dual security mode”, you’re not gonna have the option to choose your own encryption algorithm, and you’re definitely not gonna have “<a href=\"https://soatok.blog/2024/07/31/what-does-it-mean-to-be-a-signal-competitor/\">plaintext but only in this very specific context</a>”. if you subpoena Signal and ask for all the info they have on a phone number, all they can tell you is <a href=\"https://signal.org/bigbrother/\">when they registered and when they last connected to the server</a>, and they’ll fight tooth and nail to keep it that way. as such any request that is reliant on Signal having more data on you is dead on the spot.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-276493-h-6-dont-try-and-argue-for-a-security-theatre-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-276493-h-6-dont-try-and-argue-for-a-security-theatre-6\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>6. don’t try and argue for a security theatre.</h1>\n<p>if a “security feature” can be easily circumvented, it should either be reframed to be something other than a security feature, or abandoned.<br>\ntake disappearing messages for example. since they were first adopted in 2016, the message was very clear: “<a href=\"https://signal.org/blog/disappearing-messages/\">Disappearing messages are a way for you and your friends to keep your message history tidy, not for situations where your contact is your adversary</a>.”<br>\nif your security feature can be circumvented then it’s not a security feature. and if it’s not a security feature, then it better be useful in some other way, otherwise it’s just there for the show and should not be in the app.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-276493-h-7-dont-chat-with-adversaries-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-276493-h-7-dont-chat-with-adversaries-7\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>7. don’t chat with adversaries.</h1>\n<p>even the best app in the world can’t save you from chatting with an adversary. if Alice is a political dissident and Bob is secretly a cop, there’s nothing Signal can do to guarantee Alice doesn’t share incriminating information with Bob. if Bob is an ally but he has malware on his phone, there’s nothing Signal can do to guarantee Alice doesn’t leak incriminating information via Bob.<br>\nSignal can and should try its best. in fact, <a href=\"https://signal.org/blog/signal-doesnt-recall/\">it often does</a>. but it can’t save you from trusting someone who isn’t trustworthy.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>you are welcome to concur or add other self-evident statements below.</p>",

While Whatsapp owes its user base to the network effect features are a way to consolidate and make it harder for people to move away from it.

Aside from the more formal communication that flows through Microsoft Teams, we’d long maintained a WhatsApp group for lighter, more relaxed exchanges. The advantage, of course, was that while not everyone was willing to install Teams on their personal devices, nearly everyone already had WhatsApp installed and in constant use.</p>\n<p>I gently broached the idea of moving to Signal, but two things became immediately clear:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Despite the fact that many of my colleagues are fairly tech-savvy, the majority didn’t see the need for a new app. WhatsApp, they argued, sufficed for their needs. Some even went as far as to ask, <em>“What do you want to hide? They already know everything about you.”</em></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The suggestion of installing yet another app was met with apathy, perhaps even resistance. The one they were already using worked well enough, and that comfort was difficult to shake.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>From this, I’ve come to the conclusion that Signal, in the eyes of my peers and acquaintances, is seen as a kind of digital fortress, an app reserved for those who must hide from authority, be it the government or their employer. As for the everyday, mundane exchanges we all have, they’ll continue to thrive in the apps already embedded in our lives, immovable and set in stone.</p>\n<p>To truly break this network effect, I believe Signal will need more than just its privacy-centric appeal. It will need a defining feature, or that killer feature as some might say, something unique, something that elevates the experience in a way no other app has managed to do. Something that taps into the everyday needs and desires people have, something that could convince them that it’s worth the switch, or at least worth trying out. Maybe it’s a unique way of organizing communication, a way of enriching the experience that no one else has yet thought of.</p>",

If I were trying to convince people to use Slack, Discord, Telegram or Matrix, it would be easier, because the polls feature is there. I might actually try to convince them of Matrix next, exactly because of this, just trying to figure out, where to host.  :)</p>\n<p>I think the difference here is exactly the “global vs. local” argument you mentioned. Just because it helps locally, doesn’t mean it corresponds to global adoption. But it can still be helpful locally nonetheless.</p>",
