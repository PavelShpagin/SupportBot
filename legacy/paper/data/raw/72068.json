These are always late at night, most of the messages are deleted when I open signal in the morning, and the unanswered incoming calls show in the string.  Her signal account/ screen does not show a record of any of these.  No one has access to her phone (and if they did these would show on her phone as coming from it. Under what scenario could this happen so I can work to resolve it.  I have screenshots to document it and can provide further details if needed to resolve it.  I’ve asked Signal several times with no response.</p>",

        "cooked": "<p>Thank you for the replies!  I’ll try to put more details here so it’s easier to follow.  The GF is the only person I use signal with, and I am the only person she uses signal with.  So for each of us we are the only contact within signal.  So the issue is that from time to time, I will receive texts and calls via signal that show as coming from her and show up within our actual text and call history.  They are not coming from another contact/phone that is just using her name as the identifier. They present to me as actually coming from her and from her account/number. These are always late at night (like spam) and when I see them the next morning, most of the texts have been deleted (they show in the string as a deleted text).  The missed calls show as missed calls. She is Iphone, I am Android if it matters.</p>\n<p>The only way that I can think of that someone could do this would be if they set up her # on their device and guessed or had her pin. (we don’t have signal on a second device, but if I understand correctly you can have it on two devices with the same account/phone #.)  What I don’t understand (maybe someone that has it on two devices could weigh in here) is that if the GF texts me and calls, that will show up on her phone history.  But if the “spammer” calls  would that only show up in on the spammer’s device and history, or do the two devices share the account so anything the spammer sends would also show up in the GF history on her phone (and vice versa)?<br>\nIt seems to me that if you are set up on two devices, the communication history would share between the devices, but maybe not in signal since the data resides on the device and not out somewhere else?</p>\n<p>If there’s anything else I can provide to help, let me know.  Not sure if a photo can be uploaded here, but I can provide screenshots if I can upload.  THANKS!</p>",

These happened only after I turned my phone off for the night, before that she and I were texting just fine.  Our settings are both set to not have disappearing messages (and I think that’s only after someone has read it anyway).  Thinking back, the last time this happened my phone was off also, and I think the two times before that a month ago I had turned my phone off.</p>\n<p>So, is there a scenario where if my phone is off (and therefore have not checked signal for 7-9 hours) that messages would self delete?  Would that be something in a setting on my end or on the sender’s end?  Or would the only way for an unread message while my phone is off to be deleted  be manually by the sender?</p>\n<p>Thank you to everyone for helping!</p>",

Is there a way to see what a deleted message said? And other than her screen log of texts and calls, would there be another location on her phone that a log exists to confirm they were or weren’t sent from her phone?<br>\nAnd of course this all begs the question, if she’s not sending them and deleting them, how can this be happening between two verified accounts with no additional devices attached to either account and no access to each phone by other people.</p>\n<p>Thank you again, this has all been helpful to get clarity on at least parts of it.</p>",

We have checked both phones for linked devices and there are none on either phone.</p>\n<p>Just did a test.  When I delete a message I sent to her, if I “delete for everyone”, it shows deleted on her end and there is a delete “tombstone” on mine.  I can however then go and delete the tombstone on mine so there is no record on my screen.  That’s a lot of steps to get to the point of not showing I ever sent anything originally, so unlikely that is happening…</p>",

        "cooked": "<p>Some new info to add in the hopes of figuring it out…</p>\n<p>First, I fully acknowledge it could be her deleting them, and unfortunately that’s the simple answer and we don’t have to look any further.  But I’m 99.9% sure she is not for a variety of reasons to lengthy to go over here.</p>\n<p>In a past post I said that this happened when my phone was off for the night.  So I’ve been leaving it on with signal open to see if it happens when open, and to see if I get messages that don’t get deleted (a clue as to where they are coming from).  So last night I got four deleted messages and I did not get the one she actually did send (unless it is one of the deleted).  So for her to be doing this, she would have had to delete messages for both of us, and then would have had to delete the the deleted message on he phone again to get rid of them on her screen. That’s a lot to go through at different times over an hour after you’ve gone to bed and need to be up early the next morning. Also, why would she delete the one she actually wanted to send and me to get?<br>\nIt seems that this deleted message thing does affect other actual texts (one other time she had sent a good night text but I never got it when the delete thing happened, just like last night).</p>\n<p>So again, assuming it is not her, how can this happen?  The only scenario (and yes, it is a stretch) is that someone has some sort of “remote access” to her phone (via spyware or malware) and therefore could access it and send and delete messages to me in signal whenever they wanted (maybe at night so the access is not detected because it would be seen during the day)?<br>\nWe moved to signal because of harassment texts by someone to both of us when we were texting on verizon’s platform.  Those followed a pattern of late at night, and if we’d been talking or texting that night (like an ability to monitor phone use). It seems like this is a more watered down version of that same thing.</p>\n<p>Thank you again!</p>",
