        "cooked": "<p>Hello. After updating to the latest version (7.73) of Signal for Linux desktop yesterday, I’m seeing some major display issues that render it basically unusable.</p>\n<p>After the update, there is a graphical bug or something where when I scroll the page, the top left portion of the chat frame scrolls normally but the remaining three quarters of the window jitter and  move slightly but do not update. If I stop scrolling and wait 15 or 20 seconds, the screen updates to draw correctly, but the problem persists if I scroll again.</p>\n<p>And clicking on menus and even typing are similarly delayed. They don’t show up at all, but the program is taking input. If I wait for 20 or so seconds, the text appears or the menu displays. But typing again or moving to click the menu causes the lag to appear again.</p>\n<p>Also, rather than launching and using icon for Signal for the program, a new icon that looks like a gear on a white background appears on the Panel. And the icon that appears in the system tray when the program is minimized doesn’t appear or function.</p>\n<p>Uninstalling the program and reinstalling from apt does not help. I even tried installing the beta version from the Software Manager, which is a different install that I had to authenticate using the phone app, but the issue is the same.</p>\n<p>In terms of my system, I’m running Linux Mint Cinnamon v22.2 in Wayland. I don’t for the life of me know what exactly changed. I had a nearly identical issue with Vivaldi a few days before, so I ended up falling back to a backup from 10/3 and have been holding off on updating Vivaldi as a result. I had a too-old version of Signal and had to update it before I could launch the program, so there’s no way to fall back for Signal. This suggests a display driver issue or something, but I specifically did not update that after falling back. The problem was there before updating drivers and was there after updating them.</p>\n<p>I’d be grateful for any assistance or information anyone could provide.</p>",

Because, it can run Wayland and ended up defaulting to it effectively because of some recent Electron issues. If Wayland is experimental in Mint, and not very reliable, then I could see that being an issue, though I would be more surprised that Signal running on X11 would be better, because that’s another layer of compatibility.</p>\n<p>I wouldn’t be using Cinnamon with Wayland if I were you, it wasn’t stable enough last time I tried it. Either use X11, or go to KDE on Fedora, that was what I ended up doing for security purposes.</p>\n<p>Even NVIDIA should work well now a days if you’re using an up to date driver, I stopped using NVIDIA (which I was only using because I was borrowing a computer) some time after Explicit Sync started to become a thing, and at the end the experience was pretty OK, especially since I was avoiding using XWayland.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>had a nearly identical issue with Vivaldi a few days before</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hmmm, both of these are Chromium!</p>"
