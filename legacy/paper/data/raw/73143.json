        "cooked": "<p>Hi, I’m desperate. Over the last few months my Signal iPad showed “Problem Retrieving Data” / ”Data Not Recovered” and I lost that device’s copy after reinstalling. This week the same error appeared on my main iPhone (where I keep ~14 GB of photos/chats). I haven’t uninstalled Signal on the iPhone (I’m keeping the app as-is) because I want the data recovered, but the app says the database is unreadable and offers no usable export/restore option.</p>\n<p>Details:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Devices: iPhone 12 mini (ios 18.0.1).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Signal app version: 7.86.2.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Exact on-screen error: “Problem Retrieving Data” / ”Data Not Recovered”.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Storage used in Signal before issue: ~14 GB (photos / chats / media).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What I tried: reinstall on iPad (lost that copy); did NOT uninstall iPhone (keeping it to avoid wiping anything). I have not deleted any chat media from Signal recently.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What I need: clear direction from Signal staff or a moderator about how to export the current data, get a debug log examined, or at least confirm whether the data can be recovered since the problem can’t be fixed. If there’s any official escalation path or engineer who can look at an uploaded debug log, please tell me how to get help.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I can supply screenshots, the debug-log link, and timestamps. I am angry and desperate, these were personal photos and messages I can’t replace. Please tell me the fastest way to get this in front of someone who can escalate or open a ticket with the engineering team. Thank you.</p>",

They should be able to recover the conversations and images as they are saved in an SQL DB and export them to multiple files (I don’t think they’ll be able to recover the app, per se). I would not expect this to cost less than 2000$ in a first-world country, specially if you go to a trustworthy place (in my opinion, you should find a company that mostly works for other businesses and only does Data Recovery, and not multiple things)</p>\n<p>Good luck, let us know if you manage to make any progress.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>There’s something else you might want to try. You can join the latest iOS beta program (see <a href=\"https://community.signalusers.org/t/beta-feedback-for-the-upcoming-ios-7-87-release/73018\">here</a>) , update to the latest Signal iOS version and post your Debug Log just like you did here. A Developer might take a look at the issue, but considering it’s not a problem directly related to this particular beta, they might not be able to help that much. However, they are more proficient than I am with iOS, so they might be able to recommend stuff that I don’t know about.</p>",
