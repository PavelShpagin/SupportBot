        "cooked": "<p>First and foremest: Thanks for Signal guys and girls! I love it and am so grateful it exists.<br>\nIn that spirit, I want Signal to be <strong>good software</strong>.</p>\n<p>Several sub points to this (I’m trying to be complete here… :))</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-280615-h-1-the-basic-problem-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-280615-h-1-the-basic-problem-1\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>1 The basic Problem</h1>\n<p>Here is the description of the - imo - biggest problem that stands in the way of Signal being the best application for communication on the planet:</p>\n<p>Alice uses Signal to call Bob:</p>\n<p>When starting a Signal call, there are two phases - <code>calling</code> and <code>ringing</code><br>\nAlice can distinguish these two (only) by what is displayed on the screen when making the call.<br>\nHowever, only during the phase <code>ringing</code> will Bob’s phone ring while during the <code>calling</code> phase Bob’s phone will stay silent.<br>\nAlice - being familiar with the workflow of a regular telephone - will typically do the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Press the button to call the person she wants to call: Bob. And after that she will</li>\n<li>Put he phone to her ear, expecting to hear bob’s voice next.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Problem now: The <code>calling</code> and <code>ringin</code> phase are not distinguished by the audio feedback in Signal:</strong> Alice hears the same ringback tone (I think this is what it’s called) whether in the<code>calling</code>or in the<code>ringing</code>phase.</p>\n<p>What often happens: Alice will hang up the phone before Bob’s phone rings. In that case, Bob will get a notification that he “missed a call” despite his phone never ringing. (Surely that is confusing!)</p>\n<p>Here’s a quote from <a href=\"https://community.signalusers.org/t/differentiate-calling-and-ringing-states-on-signal-desktop/61621/2\">this post, where I first mentioned the problem</a> last year:</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"oeoeb\" data-post=\"2\" data-topic=\"61621\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/user_avatar/community.signalusers.org/oeoeb/48/41174_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"><a href=\"https://community.signalusers.org/t/differentiate-calling-and-ringing-states-on-signal-desktop/61621/2\">Differentiate \"Calling\" and \"Ringing\" States on Signal Desktop</a></div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I estimate 50% to 70% of the calls I receive never ring on my phone: People are not aware that they have to wait until the “ringing” phase for the phone to actually ring. If this is due to spotty wifi / reception on the recipient or what else, I don’t know. But it happens A LOT for A LOT of my Signal using friends and family.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>I would re-phrase that now to “50% to 70% of people that I have signal calls with fall into this trap” because most of my calls are with the same people and I have explained this situation to them often enough that they know now.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-280615-h-2-another-aspect-to-this-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-280615-h-2-another-aspect-to-this-2\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>2 Another aspect to this</h1>\n<p>Here’s another thing I noticed. Again the situation is that Alice is calling Bob.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Alice calls Bob via Signal</li>\n<li>Alice enters the <code>calling</code> phase. Alice is aware that Bob’s phone is not ringing yet and she is patiently waiting.</li>\n<li>She waits a long time but the <code>ringing</code> phase never starts</li>\n<li>Alice hangs up and calls again</li>\n<li>The <code>ringin</code> phase is entered withing the first second.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I have noticed this exact behavior playing out so often that I am already using this a s a workaround to establish my day to day calls: Enter <code>calling</code>, immediately hang up and can call again. More often than not, this leads to immediate <code>ringing</code> and the phone call is established in less time.</p>\n<p>The fact that I can do some manual steps to (imo successfully) reduce the time to establish a live call is a clear sign to me that there is a better implementation possible here!</p>\n<p>Yes that’s a backend problem, and here’s the UX section, but:<br>\nYes, this is a UX problem as well.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading.<br>\nThanks for Signal!</p>\n<p>What do <strong>you</strong> think about this <code>Calling</code> / <code>Ringign</code> workflow?</p>",

From a user’s perspective, it makes little sense to me that the same tone is used for both ‘calling’ and “ringing.” To be honest, it is confusing.

        "cooked": "<p>years ago I I submitted a pull request for updated calling sounds. It included enhancement to the sound caulity (removing static noice), improved track lenght for perfect looping audio which starts at 0ms, and adding a variation of the calling sound to be used as dialing sound.</p>\n<p>The devs had removed dialing (which was known as the sonar ping sound) because it was confusing to some. My solution was to make dialing and calling sound very similar, but with a sligtly different interval of silence between the tones. You could hear the difference, but it wouldn’t bother anyone who didn’t care to hear if dialing turned to calling.</p>\n<p>Cody had repeaditly attempted to get it merged, but did not dind himself backed by other de developers. It went state and unusued. Part of that might be that my pull request wasn’t by itself a full solution, I’m not a programmer.</p>\n<p>Just the subtle audio clue would not be enough to help users understand what us going on. The call screen should show in text something like ‘not yet connected’ rather than ‘dialialing’. The key words 'not yet’ would be a way more obvious clue that the calling state is unusual. Because that is what we want users to know, this is not usual ringing, this is something unusual, stuck before ringing. Alternatively something like ‘attempting to connect’ rather than 'connecting’. Just some clear and obvious wording to show the call is pending to reach the usual ringing.</p>\n<p>The text could also be a different color , or turn a color after a few seconds, to make the unusual state catch your eye.</p>\n<p>When dialing times out without connecting, a warning could pop-up ‘Could not connect, their phone did not ring’. Again important to explicitly state ‘did not ring’. It means the other person might necer know you called them. A key piece of subtle information.</p>\n<p>these are the audio files i meantioned</p>\n<aside class=\"onebox githubpullrequest\" data-onebox-src=\"https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/pull/8948/files\">\n  <header class=\"source\">\n\n      <a href=\"https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/pull/8948/files\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android</a>\n  </header>\n\n  <article class=\"onebox-body\">\n    <div class=\"github-row\" data-github-private-repo=\"false\">\n\n\n\n    <div class=\"github-icon-container\" title=\"Pull Request\">\n      <svg width=\"60\" height=\"60\" class=\"github-icon\" viewBox=\"0 0 12 16\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M11 11.28V5c-.03-.78-.34-1.47-.94-2.06C9.46 2.35 8.78 2.03 8 2H7V0L4 3l3 3V4h1c.27.02.48.11.69.31.21.2.3.42.31.69v6.28A1.993 1.993 0 0 0 10 15a1.993 1.993 0 0 0 1-3.72zm-1 2.92c-.66 0-1.2-.55-1.2-1.2 0-.65.55-1.2 1.2-1.2.65 0 1.2.55 1.2 1.2 0 .65-.55 1.2-1.2 1.2zM4 3c0-1.11-.89-2-2-2a1.993 1.993 0 0 0-1 3.72v6.56A1.993 1.993 0 0 0 2 15a1.993 1.993 0 0 0 1-3.72V4.72c.59-.34 1-.98 1-1.72zm-.8 10c0 .66-.55 1.2-1.2 1.2-.65 0-1.2-.55-1.2-1.2 0-.65.55-1.2 1.2-1.2.65 0 1.2.55 1.2 1.2zM2 4.2C1.34 4.2.8 3.65.8 3c0-.65.55-1.2 1.2-1.2.65 0 1.2.55 1.2 1.2 0 .65-.55 1.2-1.2 1.2z\"></path></svg>\n    </div>\n\n  <div class=\"github-info-container\">\n\n\n\n      <h4>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/pull/8948/files\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Enhance call sounds: Reduce backgroundnoise on ringing sounds, reduce filesize, reintroduce 'connecting' sound, add 'call ended' sound</a>\n      </h4>\n\n    <div class=\"branches\">\n      <code>main</code> ← <code>Meteor0id:enhance_ringing_sounds</code>\n    </div>\n\n      <div class=\"github-info\">\n        <div class=\"date\">\n          opened <span class=\"discourse-local-date\" data-format=\"ll\" data-date=\"2019-07-24\" data-time=\"14:56:32\" data-timezone=\"UTC\">02:56PM - 24 Jul 19 UTC</span>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"user\">\n          <a href=\"https://github.com/Meteor0id\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n            <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/uploads/db3609/original/3X/e/1/e1c0f6fb44d8ae9c6ce3f64cd61a6a588d5d30cb.png\" class=\"onebox-avatar-inline\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" data-dominant-color=\"A9D8F6\">\n            Meteor0id\n          </a>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"lines\" title=\"4 commits changed 9 files with 11 additions and 4 deletions\">\n          <a href=\"https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/pull/8948/files\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n            <span class=\"added\">+11</span>\n            <span class=\"removed\">-4</span>\n          </a>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  <div class=\"github-row\">\n    <p class=\"github-body-container\">### First time contributor checklist\n\n- [x] I have read [how to contribute](ht<span class=\"show-more-container\"><a href=\"https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/pull/8948\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" class=\"show-more\">…</a></span><span class=\"excerpt hidden\">tps://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to this project\n- [x] I have signed the [Contributor License Agreement](https://whispersystems.org/cla/)\n\n### Contributor checklist\n\n- [x] I am following the [Code Style Guidelines](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/wiki/Code-Style-Guidelines)\n- [ ] I have tested my contribution on these devices:\n * Device A, Android X.Y.Z\n * Device B, Android Z.Y\n * Virtual device W, Android Y.Y.Z\n- [ ] My contribution is fully baked and ready to be merged as is\n- [x] I ensure that all the open issues my contribution fixes are mentioned in the commit message of my first commit using the `Fixes #1234` [syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/)\n\n----------\n\n### Description\nRemoving the Sonar Ping sound has left some users unhappy, because they can no longer hear an audible difference between the connecting phase and the ringing phase. @geyson-signal argued that the sound was not necessary, but did make the call seem longer which could be a negative experience (https://community.signalusers.org/t/beta-feedback-for-the-upcoming-android-4-33-release/5880/23?u=meteor0id) . From reactions in the following days it became apparent some kind of distinct sound is actually preferred by some users, and I think that especially the visually impaired would greatly benefit from this difference, since they might not be able to reply on the textual difference on their call screen. As a solution, in this PR I propose to revert the changes made when removing sonar ping, but instead of the sonar ping sound use a sound which is much closer to the ringing sound itself. The idea is that anyone who doesn't care to hear the difference won't, but someone who pays attention to it can clearly hear it. The new connecting sound is identical to the ringing sound with the sole exeption being that the connecting sound is slightly shorter than the ringing sound (and thus also loops a bit faster).\n\nI have also taken the opportunity to preform some noise reduction on the ringing and busy sounds. I have done this using audacity. I have take great care to preserve the old and authentic sound of the ringing sounds, while reducing the static, and making the quiet actually quiet. The timing of the tracks has also been perfected, to assure the looping is seamless from now on.\n\nExcuse my ugly attempt to update my own master branch. GitHub isn't my thing.</span></p>\n  </div>\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n<p>Greyson at tje time wrote that if you are curious if you are connected or dialing you can read that on the screen. But I am thinking you wouldn’t look at the screen if usually it connects right away and you noticed nothing unusual. That’s why I propose 1. A slightly fifferent sound to trigger you to look. 2. a warning 'the call ended without ringing their phone,no connection could be made’ which stays on screen after the call.</p>\n<p>And ofc these files are the same audio but without the static noice. I simply noice canceled based on a noice profile of the static heard in the silent parts of the audio.</p>\n<p>and there is no silence at the start of the audio, to not have any dellay and make looping the sound or switching between sounds easy</p>",
