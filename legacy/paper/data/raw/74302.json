        "cooked": "<p>I wanted to post this here under just \u201cSupport\u201d rather than OS-specific, because I figure the question is universal, but it seems the forum won\u2019t let me, and since I have Apple\u2026</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve searched around for the answer, I really have, but cannot find discussion of this topic. It\u2019s particularly disappointing that Signal does not have a FAQ on this on their own support site.</p>\n<p>What happens when you delete the app from your phone, but you are NOT leaving Signal, switching devices, or changing your phone number? Let\u2019s say you are not concerned about preserving message history. For whatever reason, I want to delete the app from my phone for a while, and then reinstall it again later, and hop right back into my former messaging life. Even in a case where you are switching to a new handset, you would want to be sure that NOTHING was left on the old one, if you were going to pass it down to your kid, or sell it to someone else.</p>\n<p>What I would like, is to be reassured, in the spirit of Signal, that ALL traces of that app and of course my messages and everything, would be SECURELY erased from the phone\u2019s storage. Ideally this would happen in a way that is so secure that even state actors would not be able to recover anything, but at least, I would want to know that my content, and the prior existence of the app, were undiscoverable by even savvy and capable non-state hackers.</p>\n<p>Is there any difference in iOS vs Android as far as this question goes?</p>\n<p>Can someone here address this question? I really appreciate any info you can offer. I should add: I sent this question at least twice (maybe 3x?) to Signal support via their email, and they completely ignored me. Is there a message buried in there?</p>",

        "cooked": "<p>Thanks for the response. This is a disappointing answer, but it sounds true: Signal probably can\u2019t do much to control HOW it is deleted by the OS. But I would like to know more about the details of what exactly will happen when it is deleted. It seems to me this is fodder for their web docs, but I have seen no sign of it there. For the user to know this, especially for people, unlike me, whose lives depend on this app, is crucial, and Signal owes its users this kind of information. I just wish I could get them to pay attention - to answer my support requests about it. It has been a few months - maybe I\u2019ll try again.</p>\n<p>To give an example of why this is particularly concerning: against my better judgement, I recently installed Facebook Messenger, because I needed to use it away from home. When I was done, I deleted the app. I was not asked if I should delete everything, including data. Just \u201cDelete App\u201d. Later, I needed to use it again, so I reinstalled. Sure enough, it remembered me - I didn\u2019t have to login again. WTF, right?</p>",
