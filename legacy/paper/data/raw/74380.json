I wonder how much criticism the media would have put on the politicians and WhatsApp. Hopefully they would have been saying “they should have used Signal”. WhatsApp is definitely less private with all the vulnerabilities that have been found in it. Apart from talking face-to-face in an isolated area without any smartphones, microphones or cameras, Signal is probably the most private and secure form of communication <img src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/images/emoji/apple/white_check_mark.png?v=14\" title=\":white_check_mark:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":white_check_mark:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\"></p>",
