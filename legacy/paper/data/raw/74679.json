href=\"https://community.signalusers.org/t/discord-will-restrict-your-account-next-month-unless-you-scan-id-or-face/74662\">Discord news</a> and the knowledge that <a href=\"https://community.signalusers.org/t/signal-media-coverage-articles-news/1458/3453\">more and more people</a> use Signal for organising, i was thinking what direction Signal could and likely will go in to benefit those two groups of people.<br>\nobviously i don’t expect Signal to ever be a full Discord replacement (<s>especially given that Discord is a machine that turns gamers into nitro subscribers</s>), but i think there’s several ways Signal could become more welcoming to either group, some easier to implement and some harder.</p>\n<p>inspired by <a href=\"https://taggart-tech.com/discord-alternatives/\">this</a> older article that’s been doing the rounds, i’m gonna propose three criteria to judge a FR by:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>it’s importance to online communities, that is to say larger groups of people who only somewhat know and trust each other, i.e. the exact communities that are now seeking a replacement for Discord. <a href=\"https://community.signalusers.org/t/signal-community-memes/8768/257\">i have been quite vocal</a> in my opinion about chatting with people you don’t trust, and while i still <a href=\"https://community.signalusers.org/t/signal-forum-truisms/71978#p-276493-h-7-dont-chat-with-adversaries-7\">vehemently believe that statement is true</a>, we’re gonna have to set it aside for the purpose of discussing the benefit to online communities, that necessarily don’t obey this assumption.</li>\n<li>it’s importance to organisers, that is to say people who do chat with people they trust but that do not engage in a regular chat, but rather are focused on specific purposes or goals. this can include stuff like political dissidents, to whom Signal has always been quite appealing, but also any other type of organiser. since i’m talking about organisers in general, i won’t be delving in this post into features that benefit people in free-speech-less countries, especially since most of these have already been implemented, though those are of course quite important.</li>\n<li>how easy i believe it will be to implement these given Signal’s current situation and the goals which are almost certain to remain unchanged. this means not just how complicated i believe a feature to be and how many changes to existing code will be involved, but also what security considerations come in to such a feature.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<h1><a name=\"p-284351-message-history-for-new-group-membershttpscommunitysignalusersorgtmessage-history-for-new-group-chat-members3679urassilon1963-1\"

while the best way to preserve history is with a wiki or a forum, many communities still use chats for those purposes.<br>\n<strong>importance to organisers</strong>: 2/5 — mostly just in scenarios where more people are coming in and can’t be tl;dr’d to.<br>\n<strong>easy to implement</strong>: likely 1/5 — mostly on the security front, since having a single source for the entire message history means that data is untrustworthy, but having everyone resend the entire history on every join is highly impractical (and probably impossible for any former members). see more info in the original thread.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-284351-communities-with-subgroupshttpscommunitysignalusersorgtcommunities-with-sub-groups43783urassilon1963-2\" class=\"anchor\"

break for some and useless for others.<br>\n<strong>easy to implement</strong>: 3/5 depending on how it’s implemented — there’s some security considerations (do you share the group keys for all groups with every member of every single one of these groups?) but otherwise shouldn’t be too hard (the most barebone form of a community just has each group natively link to the rest and it’d still be quite good as an implementation).</p>\n<h1><a

already mostly trust the people in the group. could be useful in highly situational scenarios.<br>\n<strong>easy to implement</strong>: probably 4/5 — basically just marrying the existing delete for everyone with the existing option to limit certain group capabilities to admins only. less security considerations (unless i’m missing something) and more, for lack of a better word, ethical considerations: should admins be given this capability? as you can see in the original thread, this is quite an active debate.</p>\n<h1><a

to be any different to other types of groups other than only certain people being able to send a message, which is a feature that already exists.<br>\n<strong>importance to organisers</strong>: 4/5 — the main difference from online communities is that without a #​general chat, channels are likely to be by far the largest group in the collection of groups used (for those that use multiple groups, see previous paragraph), which could make it cumbersome.<br>\n<strong>easy to implement</strong>: 3/5 — depending on implementation, could possibly still be a regular group behind the scenes which makes things easier but has security considerations, could just be a list of people to DM all at once, which is easy to make but lacks clarity of being a channel to recipients, otherwise <a

very useful for moderation. same reason this very forum has trust levels.<br>\n<strong>importance to organisers</strong>: 1/5 — unless for some reason you don’t trust the people you’re chatting with, then you’re more similar to an online community.<br>\n<strong>easy to implement</strong>: 2/5 — mostly due to the <a href=\"https://community.signalusers.org/t/development-ideology/26\">large amount of option screens</a> that will be required to make such options easily configurable, unless such roles come preconfigured, which would require some amount of imposition by Signal. might become easier

— situational, but could be very important to those who need it. most online communities don’t kick inactive members though.<br>\n<strong>importance to organisers</strong>: 3/5 — situational again. many organising groups have a somewhat temporary nature to them anyway, so such a feature won’t be necessary to them. otherwise could be useful.<br>\n<strong>easiness to implement</strong>: 2/5 — since the server can’t look into groups (good), would require tracking on the client end how long since a member has last been active, then a kickout mechanism that works nicely if there’s more than one admin. requires lots of changes and prone to breaking.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-284351-live-location-sharinghttpscommunitysignalusersorgtlive-location-sharing2564urassilon1963-7\" class=\"anchor\"

is usually online only, you probably wouldn’t give them any location of yours, let alone a live one.<br>\n<strong>importance to organisers</strong>: 4/5 — somewhat situational but extremely useful when needed. not a 5/5 simply because in many situations the regular location sharing is less comfortable but still suffices.<br>\n<strong>easy to implement</strong>: 3/5 — several security and technical considerations. see original thread.</p>\n<h1><a

3/5 — i personally am in some communities where this is an absolute must-have, and others where it’s unnecessary. however, in most cases threading is actually better served by forum infrastructure, where the conversation is also more permanent.<br>\n<strong>importance to organisers</strong>: 2/5 — could be useful in highly specific instances, but otherwise cases where discussion must be split from an existing group and a new group wouldn’t suffice are quite rare.<br>\n<strong>easy to implement</strong>: 3/5 — lots of UI changes and some internal changes to messages. not too terrible, but also not that easy to do.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-284351-group-custom-member-labelshttpscommunitysignalusersorgtgroup-members-custom-labels41241urassilon1963-9\" class=\"anchor\"

better served by the following FR and by true broadcast lists.<br>\n<strong>easy to implement</strong>: 2/5 — involves many moving parts, and any such change will have to be watertight when it comes

separate broadcast option.<br>\n<strong>easy to implement</strong>: probably 4/5 — assuming custom labels include mentioning, mostly because there’s a need to also add controls over this

perspective, 5/5) — a one that’s a bit weird to rank, since in some sense bot support already exists in Signal, you just need an appropriate client. and such clients exist, and Signal bots already exist (i personally have already encountered one). however, when it comes to the question of an official bot support, it’s not just a question of is this easy to do, but more is it likely to happen, the answer to which is probably no, because since the server can’t inspect groups and chats (good), this has high spam implications.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>feel free to suggest (and similarly rank!) any more improvements and changes that you think could be relevant to Signal better supporting either of these types of users. <strong>let’s not discuss the merits of each request here though</strong>, use the
