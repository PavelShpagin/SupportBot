(Edit:  see <a href=\"https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/5153#issuecomment-280251299\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Link devices manually without QR · Issue #5153 · signalapp/Signal-Android · GitHub</a> by Moxie in early 2017… this is “on the roadmap” but no timeline given.)  If you want my guesstimate-hunch, it seems unlikely this will happen soon, because it is difficult to keep messages private without having a strong security-linkage between the slave-devices and the master-device.  Moreover, using the optional anti-MitM verification works using QR codes via signal4smartphone’s built-in QR-scanner, as well. Like using signal4desktop, verifying safety-nums is non-mandatory / optional, partly because it requires hardware that does not always exist/work on the endpoint-device.  Not everybody owns a laptop, and not everybody has a functional phone-cam.</p>\n<p>Maybe it would make sense, that if clicked eight times, the rendered QR-code imagefile on signal4desktop would display an all-numeric-version, and if tapped eight times, the QR-scanner over on signal4android would reveal a hidden text-area where the vNumpad could be used to tap in the 100-digit-linkage-string?</p>\n<p>At present, by design there is always exactly one single smartphone-device associated with a given signal-num backed by a matching underlying telco-num, and up to five (or six?) slave-devices running signal4desktop on 64-bit x86-based windows/linuxDEB/osx systems like a laptop or PC are allowed.  Some functionality is only available in the master-smartphone-device:  addressbook-integration, createGroup / LeaveGroup / etc, full text search, cryptocalls/SMS/MMS, and various other shortcomings of slave-devices.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"tsobey\" data-post=\"1\" data-topic=\"7824\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/t/ed655f/48.png\" class=\"avatar\"> tsobey:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>appear to be a recurring problem</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>One of the biggest shortcomings is, methinks, the level of UX complexity/prereqs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>install signal4smartphone first from the internet, it is required by signal4desktop</li>\n<li>register with a valid telco-num beforehand, to get into the slave-linkage-submenu</li>\n<li>install signal4desktop onto a supported OS and CPU, from the internet</li>\n<li>launch signal4desktop to display the linkage-QR-code onto the laptop-screen</li>\n<li>launch signal4smartphone, and use the linked device menu to scan the laptop’s QR from within signal4smartphone’s built-in scanner-component via phone-cam</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If there is a failure at any stage, sometimes there are workaround and sometimes there are not workarounds.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"tsobey\" data-post=\"1\" data-topic=\"7824\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://community.signalusers.org/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/t/ed655f/48.png\" class=\"avatar\"> tsobey:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>my phone’s camera does not work</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>In your particular situation, the problem is that you have a phone-cam which does not work.

However, there is another way to look at the problem:  what is the purpose you are installing signal4desktop to solve, what is the motive?  Sometimes you don’t need signal4desktop proper, to get some of the advantages people want from it.</p>\n<details>\n<summary>\nwilder tricks:  ext keyb, ext display, remote-ctrl, android VM, laptop-only</summary>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>In particular, if you want a larger hardware-keyboard, you CAN control your signal4smartphone handset via bluetooth-keyb, or via usb-dongle-adapter which allows you to plug in a regular usb-keyb from a PC, into your smartphone.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you mostly want a larger display, there are several kinds of workaround (depending on your exact handset-model and OS version) where you can try to Miracast or HDMI-out or otherwise get your smartphone to put pixels onto an external screen distinct from the handset-touchscreen.  <a href=\"https://community.signalusers.org/t/scan-barcode-when-opening-signal/4581/4\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Scan barcode when opening Signal - #4 by 5_c_d</a> and <a href=\"https://community.signalusers.org/t/run-signal-desktop-in-portable-mode/7571/6\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Run Signal Desktop in portable mode - #6 by 5_c_d</a> have more details.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There are also various sorts of remote-control-my-phone type software solutions, where you install a remote-controller-application onto your laptop, and then install a remote-controllee-app onto your smartphone, which allows you to “see your phone in a laptop-window” kind of thing.  This is not as good as signal4desktop which is NOT reverse-tethered, but people used to the whatsapp4web approach where the smartphone <em>must</em> be on and connected and internet-enabled and charged, might be satisfied with this kind of a workaround.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you really want to have SOME kind of signalapp on your laptop, and you have a secondary telco-num available (landline or work-phone or twilio voip or google-voice or various gratis service-providers in certain situations), one thing you <em>can</em> do is to install a virtual-machine onto your laptop, such as the AndroidEmulator thing that comes with AndroidStudio, hand-compile signal4android, install it into the VM on your laptop, register with a secondary phone-num, and then use <strong>that</strong> as your signalapp-on-a-laptop solution?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can go further, and install signal4android into a VM on your laptop, then utilizing an external usb-webcam, also install signal4desktop on that same laptop, and take a picture of your own laptop-screen to link the signal4android to the signal4desktop slave!  This allows you to utilize signal without ever getting a physical smartphone-handset at all, and requires just one laptop and a bit of fiddling around to get it working.  There is a downside that you cannot usually fit your laptop in your bluejeans pocket, and cannot usually hold your laptop to your head during a cryptocall in the signal4android VM, but some folks won’t mind.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>At least one person, uses the following trick:   install unofficial AsamK/signal-cli fork onto laptop as a master-device, install unofficial Trolldemorted/signal-android fork which has been modified to support slave-device operation (and link it to cli-master), install official signal4desktop and also link it to cli-master.  <a href=\"https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/5153#issuecomment-280514487\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Link devices manually without QR · Issue #5153 · signalapp/Signal-Android · GitHub</a> …however note that this comment is from 2017 when signal4chromeApp was still around, it is now fully unsupported and you should instead use the modern signal4desktop nowadays (presumably it can still link to a cli-master but the steps will obviously differ from the signal4chromeApp steps that <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/trolldemorted\">@Trolldemorted</a> gives)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</details>",
