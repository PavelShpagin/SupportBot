I disagree (see below), but I’ll happily play the game if it’ll make sure that my follow-up arguments are heard (since it seems that they weren’t on GitHub) :)</p>\n<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> (because I know it’s long, sorry) replies preserve message content even if the original was a disappearing message. This violates principle of least surprise and is dangerous. We should err on the safe side and delete these quoted replies too because there is little downside and potentially a lot of upside. This situation can arise easily if disappearing messages are turned on for one sensitive message and then immediately turned off again.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Essentially the problem is that if a disappearing message is replied to in a non-disappearing message, the disappearing message content is leaked in the reply even after the original is gone.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-33333-steps-to-reproduce-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-33333-steps-to-reproduce-1\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Steps to reproduce</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Set disappearing messages in some conversation to e.g. 5 minutes (it doesn’t really matter)</li>\n<li>Send a message</li>\n<li>Turn off disappearing messages</li>\n<li>Send a new message with the first message set as the message being replied to</li>\n<li>Wait for the first message to expire</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Actual result:</strong> The text and (if applicable) picture of the first, now-disappeared message can be viewed in the reply.</p>\n<p><strong>Expected result:</strong> The message should be truly gone (note that tapping on the reply <em>does</em> say “original message not available”). I would suggest a “(message disappeared)” placeholder or something but it doesn’t really matter.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>According to the Signal developer who responded, this is working as intended because quote-replying a message is like “copying” the message. Here’s my response to that:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/greyson-signal\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">@greyson-signal</a> that makes sense now that you say it. However, the problem here is that users understand very well the semantics of copy and paste and they understand that it’s making a <em>copy</em> of the message. That’s not the case with replies because replies - and disappearing messages (and how those features interact) - is not a universally understood UX metaphor. That kind of rich conversation element is too new.</p>\n<p>I obviously can’t speak for anyone else, but personally I thought of the reply feature as mostly just referencing an older message. Indeed that’s how it’s presented in the UI: a preview of the “referenced” message is shown and you can tap it to be taken to the full original. I understand that technically that may not be how it works but that’s beside the point - I don’t think it’s at all clear in the UI that these messages will be retained.</p>\n<p>(See GitHub for a list of alternatives I thought of and rejected.)</p>\n<p>Another argument in favor of making this change is the <strong>principle of least surprise</strong>: features should behave in a way that is least surprising. I argue that at least some users, possibly many users, will be surprised that disappearing messages do not disappear when quoted in replies. However, I doubt that any user would be surprised if they <em>did</em> disappear in replies, so we should pick the latter since that surprises less users (and errs on the safe side too). Signal is about usable security and it should do the Right Thing™ by default, without users needing to know details like this. (This argument, of course, ignores the code maintainability cost, but I think that’s a small price to pay.)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>On GitHub it also became clear that it wasn’t immediately obvious in what situations this would become a problem. However, this is very easy to trigger if (like me) you tend to carry on conversations normally but will turn on disappearing messages for one or two sensitive messages only, and then immediately turn them off again. The disappearing message is natural to quote in a non-disappearing message if it’s the only part of the conversation that’s disappearing.</p>",

It is about erasing the message bubble, not about erasing the actual message text itself. The message can always linger on the device of a group chat member who hasn’t opened his chat yet. A message simply can’t be securely erased remotely, so this feature can’t be regarded as a security solution anyway.<br>\nI agree this doesn’t become apparent from the current in app texts, but that seems to be how it is designed to work.</p>",

Deleting a quoted message’s preview alongside with the original message would lead to the newer message <strong>losing its context</strong> …</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>I guess some people argue that Since the quoted part of the message is always just the first few words, that context is already lost anyway.</p>\n<p>So I am thinking, what could in theory happen here:<br>\nIf I’m in a group chat, and I open the chat and see a disappearing message. Now I have seen it, the time will start running for me. I leave the chat, and don’t reopen it for a while. When I come back into the chat that dosappearing message is long gone, but someone quoted it to reply to it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>if the quote would be deleted, than I don’t can’t see what message is being quoted</li>\n<li>if the quote would still show the first words of the message, at least i have a chance to recall which message this is refering to.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So although I don’t like it, I have to admit <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/picob\">@PiCob</a> has a point. There are scenarios where the quoted reply cannot honor disappearing messages, because the message might have disappearded for me but someone else migbt still try quote repy to it. I woudn’t get any context.</p>\n<p>I am also thinking about the future of quoted messages. I have written a feature request, to request that we can quote selected segments of previous messages. <a href=\"https://community.signalusers.org/t/quote-reply-to-selected-characters/7210\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Quote/reply to selected characters (only a part of the message text)</a><br>\nIf something like that gets implemented in the future, than the context which quotes provide becomes even more relevant. That means that removing the qupted text can seriously derail the conversation, because some people in a group might not be able to see the same context as others.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind messages timers start when you have seen the message, so in a group the messages don’t disappear at the same time for everyone.</p>\n<p>I think deleting the text from the original messsage is not worth the chance that conversations will lose context. Furthermore, if you trust participants of the chat you are in, you can also trust them to not abuse quotes on purpose, and if they happen to quote a very sensitive message just after you turn of dosappearing message timers, than you can always ask them to delete it manually.</p>\n<p>There are two different solutions I can think off, both of which you could write a feature request for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>feature: add a button to propose to all members of the conversation to delete message history up till a certain message.</li>\n<li>feature: make disappearing messages unquotable if the disappearing message timer had been turned off, or if the disappearing message timer has been set to a much longer time interval.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I for one don’t need a solution to this issue, but if you wish to continue to find one msybe one of those features could help for you.</p>",
