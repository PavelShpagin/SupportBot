Then, once you’ve collected all the chat-bubbles you wanted to copy, save the file as .DOC and forward it to your +3-333-333-3333 conversation.  This is not much use if you don’t have a word-viewer-app you trust on your device … by default on android those are opened in GoogleDocs, uploaded to the cloud without special prompting, so this is <em>not</em> a great workaround for sure!</p>",

Alice might <em>assume</em> that Bob is in control of his device, and that Bob has not given his unlocked handset to Eve, but Alice cannot <strong>know for sure</strong> those things are true.  All that Alice knows for sure is that if the safety-num hasn’t changed, and the verified checkmark is still being displayed, is that the person chatting with her is in possession of Bob’s unlocked device.  <em>Presumably</em> that is Bob… but it might not be (per xkcd 538 and so on).</p>\n<p>Ideally it would be nice if there was a way to let Alice verify that Bob himself, was indeed on the other end… and cryptocall with video <em>is</em> pretty close to that goal… but not perfect, not definitive, as the recent video of fakeZuckerberg tends to prove.</p>",
