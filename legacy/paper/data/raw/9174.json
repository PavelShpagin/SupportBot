        "cooked": "<p>If you really want to be sure you are chatting securely, you need to verify who you are chatting with. For that purpose Signal offers the safety number.</p>\n<p>If you really need to be sure that your conversations are secret, you actually need to verify two things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You need to verify the identity of the person you think you are chatting with, to make sure you are not chatting with an imposter. Because even if the chat is secure, you still need to know for sure who you are chatting with.</li>\n<li>You need to verify that the end-point of the end-to-end encryption is actually on his device, and not on the device of a man in the middle who is simply passing messages back and forth while copying or altering them.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>This is how you verify the identity of the person you think you are chatting with</strong>:<br>\nJust because you have seen someone before, doesn’t mean he isn’t an imposter from the very moment you saw him. It is usually easy to check if a person really is who he says he is: Verify his credentials, call the people who work(ed) with him. Look him up in on-line registers. Show people who are supposed to know him a picture of his face and ask if it belongs with the name.<br>\nBecause you are going to be mentioning his name and showing his face to others, ask his permission to do this first. If he doesn’t give you permission to verify his identity, no matter what the excuse, you can’t trust him.</p>\n<p><strong>This is how you verify that the end-point of the end-to-end encryption is actually on his device</strong>:<br>\nWhen you verify that you both see the same safety number, you are actually verifying that you are both at the opposite ends of the same secure connection. If you both see the same safety number, you know for sure that your communication is not being intercepted, and no one is able to read long.<br>\nBut in checking whether you both see the same number, you have to first communicate about the safety number. This is where an attacker might try to trick you, and you need to be careful:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>You might be tempted to just send your safety number by a Signal-message or SMS and ask “Is this what you see also?”. Don’t do that. Your contact might write “no” but the attacker can manipulate the messages and simply change it to “yes”.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You might be tempted to ask him to write his safety number to you. Don’t do that, because the attacker does gave a secure connection with you and can indeed give you the correct safety number, but that wasn’t send to you by the contact you thought you were chatting with, but by the attacker.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You might ask him to write his safety number and the date of today on a wrinkled piece of paper and hold that in front of his face. By writing down the date you know it is not an attacker reusing an older image. By wrinkling the paper it becomes much harder to Photoshop and replace the text on the paper, but these days most people can still replace that text on the wrinkled paper and make it look real. So don’t do that either.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You might want him to read his safety number to you in an audio message. But if your attacker is sophisticated, he might be able to synthesize a voice using software.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You might be tempted to ask him to show or read the safety number in a video. Don’t rely on that either, because a very advanced attacker can create a fake video or alter a video.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You might be tempted to ask your contact to call or video chat with you live. A very advanced attacker can even create a real time fake live stream of what seems to be your contact, but is actually computer generated. You can even ask this person to hold up a piece of paper or stick up a certain number of fingers, but an actor could be doing those things while some software replaces his face with that of your contact.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You might think it is sufficient to verify the safety number using just one communication channel: either an email or a phone call or an SMS text message. You must however consider than if an advanced attacker is really targeting you or your contact, he may also be manipulating your email, SMS message or phone call (thus even modify the number before it arrives). You would better use multiple communication channels, sending your safety number through a Twitter direct message, and an email, and an SMS message. It may seem overkill but if you really are under surveillance it is worth doing this to be really sure.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So what options do you have left?<br>\nFirst let me clarify that most attackers will only be able to fake the first three cases. Only very advanced attackers who are really investing their time and resources in you might go as far as fake audio and video. Unless you lead a large protest or resistance movement under an oppressive regime, you don’t need to worry about 4, 5, 6 and 7.</p>\n<p>Options if you are in real danger of being spied on by a government agency, for example if you are a member of parliament in a country at war and you fear that some government agency of another country will do anything to intercept or manipulate you communications:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Meet your contact in person and look at the safety number on his screen. It doesn’t matter whether you read the numbers yourself or scan the QR-code, verification in person is very reliable.</li>\n<li>If you prefer to verify without meeting in person: share the same safety number with your contact multiple different communication channels. Send your safety number to them over a direct message on Twitter, and in an email, and in an SMS message. Even the most relentless of security agencies won’t go as far as to alter all your communications over every method and platform. You don’t need to worry about anyone intercepting the safety number and reading it, because even if an attacker intercepts your safety number, he can’t use it. If he tries to take over the communication between you and your contact, the safety number will automatically reset, and you would verify the new number and the identity of your contact again.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Did you verify your contact? Flip the slider in Signal to mark your contact as verified. Signal will now give you a more advanced warning if the safety number changes. Until that happens you are safe. If the safety number does change however, you will have to verify the secure connection and also the identity of the person you are chatting with again.</p>\n<p>If the safety number ever changes, you will have to go though these steps all over again to make sure the chat is not being intercepted, and you have to verify the identity again to make sure the secure connection is still with the same person.</p>\n<p>You can make it easier to verify the identity of your contact if the safety number changes in the future. You can’t skip the steps to verify if the connection is secure though, so you first have to exchange safety numbers with him over multiple channels again.<br>\nBefore the safety number changes and after you have verified both the identity of your contact and that the Signal chat is not being intercepted, you can agree with each other on certain questions and answers which only the two of you know. If the safety number ever changes, you still have to go though the steps to verify that the chat is not being intercepted. Only after you verified that the chat is not being intercepted, should you ask a few of the agreed on questions, to make sure you are still chatting with the same person.<br>\nYou might think a video call or picture with his face can suffice, but it doesn’t, because you could be looking at a recording or old picture of him. You need to actually send a challenge which only the real him can give the correct answer to.</p>\n<p>Edit:<br>\nSomeone asked if you could also just post your QR-code publicly. Yes, you can do that, but keep in mind the QR-code is only generated when you start a conversation, and that the QR-code is different for every conversation you have with another person. You can’t generate one QR-code to verify all your conversations and be done with it.</p>",

        "cooked": "<p>Meeting in person is ideal to verify safety numbers, but what if you can not verify safety numbers in person, well safety numbers are designed so that they can be posted in public. The only risk of posting safety numbers in public is that it can be brute forced to reveal both you and your contacts phone number, so using a different encrypted means of communication for example ProtonMail to verify safety numbers would be an alternative. If you’ve met your contact on the internet or through the phone and you want to verify safety numbers using alternative means of communication, but at the same time authenticate the person it is important to try to;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Catch the person in a lie</strong>- surely you don’t want to associate yourself with somebody who lies, because lying is suspicious activity. Gather as much information about the person as you can early on casually without making them feel uncomfortable or them realising your tactic. A liar would change facts over time about themselves, or their stories over time would not match their facts about themselves. Always great to get the person talking about themselves.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Confirm if your contact is not a computer</strong>- unlike humans computer simulations are usually designed to not make mistakes when they speak, and humans have a lot of inconsistencies in their speach/ voice and facial expressions. Watch for spelling errors/ incorrect grammar. Computers usually do not have a sense of humour so laughing and joking is great.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So however you go about using all this is up to you. A consistent liar or sophisticated adversary can defeat all this, so these are just basic techniques you can try out. Eventually you want to meet in person!</p>",

You can check for that by asking over the other not-Signal channel “what is our Signal Safety Number.” If he gives you the right number you know there is no MITM on your Signal communication. You will still not know i there was a man in the middle on the other channel, so you should never ask the same personal question twice.</p>\n<p>One downside is that if he tells you the safety number, he now can’t ask you the safety number so he still does not know if there is a MITM or not. A solution could be that you ask each other only half of the safety number.</p>\n<p>Almost no one needs to verify safety numbers like this, but if you are at risk of being spied on by a government agency, you must assume they will think of every chance they can get to spy on your chats. In such a case you really really need to consider every single step to make absolutely sure.<br>\nYou must verify 1. that you are chatting to the real person you were wanting to chat with. 2. That there is no MITM on your signal chat. And the way to do so is by checking the safety number throuh another method of communication. Even if there is a MITM on that other method, he can’t compromise your Signal chat by knowing the safety number.</p>",
