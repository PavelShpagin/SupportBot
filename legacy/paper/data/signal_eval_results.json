    "question": "I have received messages inside the app asking me to enter my 64 digit recovery code. This seems really odd, because there should be no reason for the app to ask this. This kind of information would, of course, be very valuable to an outside attacker.\nI have read reports of phishing attempts by malicious actors to gain access to signal users’ messages. So: Is this a phishing attempt?\nScreenshots in German attached.\nIMG_1512817×1138 71.6 KB\nIMG_1511828×299 46.2 KB",
    "bot_answer": "It appears you've received messages in the app asking for your 64-digit recovery code, which is raising concerns about a potential phishing attempt.\n\nIt is extremely important that you **do not share your recovery code with anyone.** This code is highly sensitive and should be kept secret. The fact that the app is unexpectedly asking for it is suspicious.\n\nWhile I don't have specific documentation or past cases directly addressing this exact scenario, the community chat history contains images from past conversations that might be related to your query about potential phishing attempts related to recovery codes [Chat: 2025-11-21, 1f6abe3d-1a55-4e1d-9c9b-097586d72ce8, 2026-01-04, 4649cc34-9c63-4d60-ba8e-0f15552a749f, 2026-01-26, 724e8985-d435-419a-81d8-b9b75765f0e2, 2025-12-14, be7e837f-4163-4683-b897-07cdced473b8]. Please check these images to see if they are similar to the messages you received.\n\nTreat this situation with extreme caution. If you are concerned about the security of your account, you may want to consider changing your password or recovery code. If the messages persist, report them to the app developers.",
    "ground_truth": "nickster:\n\nHence, I have the worry that the Signal app has been hacked in a serious way to distribute these legimate looking messages.\n\n\nNo. If the app itself were hacked in such a way as to be able to directly ask for your recovery code then whatever hacker would already have access to all your message content and wouldn’t need to ask.\nThose are legitimate reminders to help users remember/verify that their recovery information is valid.\nA phishing attempt would generally be in the form of a message from another user who was impersonating Signal (eg, they might have the Signal icon as a profile picture and try to have a display name that says something like “Signal Admin” and put emoji that look like the verified checkmark in it, etc)",
